					<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Pat,</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">The letters sent to </span><em><span lang="DE">The Red Hand Files</span></em><span lang="EN-US"> are mostly beautiful, full of love and a joy to read, but I do get the odd unkind message. Generally, though, I like them and find them weirdly energising. There is nothing quite like a good death threat in the morning to get the juices flowing. They are a form of validation, really, as </span><span lang="EN-US">no one with a public platform and an opinion is doing his or her job effectively if they are not being attacked from time to time.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Having said that, Pat, when you say that we are living in a </span><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">‘</span><span lang="EN-US">time of cynicism and cruelty</span><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">’</span><span lang="EN-US">, I am not sure I agree with you. I think we are living through a frightening and deeply uncertain time, and though there are dementing and cynical voices out there, which are being emboldened and amplified by social media — that loony engine of outrage — they do not represent the voices of the many, or the good. My experience of <em>actual people</em> in this time is overwhelmingly positive — there is a great deal of love and mutual regard and community. I think most of us understand that in order to rise above this particular moment we must pull together, and act with civility, generosity and kindness. We have a monumental task ahead of us that will require vast reserves of energy — we must rehabilitate the world — and this fellow feeling and mutual respect is essential to the process.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Of course, there is much in our world that is in need of change, to be set to rights, and clearly humanity is complex, conflicted and full of faults, but at this moment in time, when our very existence hangs in the balance, we need to come together not just in good faith and consolation, but also in a spirit of creativity and invention. </span><span lang="EN-US">Our existence depends upon offering the best of ourselves. Negativity, cynicism and resentment will not do. </span><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">‘</span><span lang="EN-US">We must love one another or die.</span><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">’</span></p>

					<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Hyun,</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">One of the truly humbling aspects of <em>The Red Hand Files</em> is the glimpse it has given me into the vast and varied sweep of human suffering. Letter after letter comes in, day after day, increasingly so during the pandemic and its recurring lockdowns, from people suffering </span><span lang="EN-US">distress due to very serious problems</span><span lang="EN-US"> — mental health issues, loneliness, homelessness, physical and mental abuse, loss of jobs, loss of loved ones, loss of dreams, loss of </span><span lang="EN-US">meaning and loss of hope.</span><span lang="EN-US"> It is a profound privilege to read these letters as it puts one</span><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">’</span><span lang="EN-US">s own struggles into perspective, and is a reminder that despite our differences, no one is immune to suffering. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">So, when I read the quote from a younger Nick Cave saying he needs catastrophes in his life to create, these words sound somewhat like the indulgent posturing of a man yet to discover the devastating effect true suffering can have on our ability to function, let alone to create. I am not only talking about personal grief, but also </span><span lang="DE">global grief, </span><span lang="EN-US">as the world is plunged deeper into this wretched pandemic. The </span><span lang="EN-US">pandemic is playing havoc with our</span><span lang="EN-US"> lives &#8211; but so is the questionable response of the lockdowns. The letters I receive through <em>The Red Hand Files</em> are testament to the devastating and largely ignored effect of lockdowns, not just on the economy, but on the very soul of the world. From reading the data — and I say this with great caution — one can</span><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">’</span><span lang="EN-US">t help but wonder if the collateral damage from the </span><span lang="EN-US">lockdowns, this</span><span lang="EN-US"> closeting of our lives, will end up outweighing the benefits.  </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Hyun, if you are living a life that is content my advice is to learn to live inside it, examine it, relish it, and most of all <em>remember it</em> — this extraordinary thing, a happy life — because there may come a time when something will present itself in the form of a misfortune, a transgression, an abuse, a failure, a humiliation, a loss, or, indeed, a global crisis where your life will turn, in an instant, from easy comfort to total chaos. It is happening all around us.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">On one level, some of this incoming despair is the routine devastation of ordinary life — suffering is always with us. </span><span lang="EN-US">Still, I pray that, ultimately, we will step beyond this extraordinary harrowing of our time to a new way, a different way, a better way. </span><span lang="EN-US">I hope we will be afforded that opportunity.  </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Love, Nick </span></p>

					<p>Dear Evan,</p>
<p>Personally, I have a lot of time for Narcotics Anonymous, but I do understand your resistance to the idea. I was the same. In my heart I never really got it — never felt the same connection other people seemed to have. I always felt outside the idea, looking in. I could never fully commit.</p>
<p>However, I think it would be fair to say if it weren’t for NA I probably wouldn’t have survived my heroin addiction. Narcotics Anonymous was this <em>thing</em>, steady and ever-present, that just never ever went away, a place I could come crawling back to, again and again, year after year, and be accepted and <em>welcomed,</em> welcomed back in. In this respect I owe Narcotics Anonymous my life. When no one else would have me, Narcotics Anonymous always would.</p>
<p>The basis of Narcotics Anonymous, the Twelve Steps, a series of suggestions as to how to live a life — the original ‘antidote to chaos’ — seems to me to be an extraordinarily effective way to navigate the world, for all people, addicts or otherwise. Having said that, I do not follow The Twelve Steps myself, to my detriment I would say. Doubtless, I would be a better person if I did.</p>
<p>In the end you find your own way. Ultimately I found mine outside of NA, with my wife, but it took Narcotics Anonymous to show me the way.</p>
<p>Reading your letter again, Evan, my advice to you — and to me — go to a fucking meeting.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

		<title>Nick Cave - The Red Hand Files - Issue #119 - I was thinking how much I wish I could write this story to you in Greek, my native language. In June one of my best friends suddenly died aged 46. He was a sailing buddy for about 20 years, since I was 18. We have sailed up and down the Aegean Sea for thousands of miles. We had booked a sailing yacht for the whole of August, just the two of us, to go sailing in the deserted - due to Covid - Aegean. He was getting married in September, and this was meant to be our own, peculiar, spiritual, bachelor party. We would take with us our music, our books and our drugs. And we would sail where the wind took us. When August came, I decided to go ahead with the journey on my own. I nailed a picture of him, Fotis, on the cockpit and begun alone, though many friends wanted to come along. But I wanted no crew. I felt somewhat like Ahab beginning a doomed voyage. I thought I should spare any crew. I took with me 4 full discographies. Yours, Pink Floyd, Radiohead, and the greatest Greek of the 20th century, Savvopoulos. And two books, Moby Dick by Melville, and Odyssey by Homer. A week in the journey this happened. I was doing a long night sail. I always enjoy night sails. The wind was light and fair, no land or human in sight. No sound from an engine but the sails gently flapping in the wind, and the bow slowly advancing through the water. I was traversing a large stretch of water eastwards, from Mykonos to Patmos. The Milky Way was shining on top of me like a crown of all that has ever been. Ghosteen was on the speakers. I was having my coffee and my morning joint (you will hopefully not share this with the Hellenic coast guard!) all alone in the very first light. As the sun begun to break from the horizon (as I was travelling eastward), Galleon Ship entered. I stood there, all alone, watching a thousand-galleon ships sailing, &quot;ghostly around the morning sun.&quot; I broke down. I was overwhelmed. It brought me to my knees. I was kneeling in the cockpit, in the twilight, moving slowly towards the sun, crying my heart out. The closest to a prayer a non-believer can experience. And then of course, the way you have the album arranged, Ghosteen started speaking to me. I am beside you I am beside you Look for me Suddenly everything made sense. I could physically sense and see the Ghosteen. Everyone singing to be free, broke free. I could almost physically sense all that has ever been, and all that will ever be. Everything had somehow clicked in my head. Loss was okay. It was only part of the game. The beauty of it all came in the foreground. I rose up and smiled at the emerging sun. So I guess all I&#039;m trying to say is this: 1) I want you to know I can see and sense the Ghosteen. It will be with me forever. Until I close my eyes. 2) Thank you. : The Red Hand Files</title>

<meta property="og:title" content="Nick Cave - The Red Hand Files - Issue #119 - I was thinking how much I wish I could write this story to you in Greek, my native language. In June one of my best friends suddenly died aged 46. He was a sailing buddy for about 20 years, since I was 18. We have sailed up and down the Aegean Sea for thousands of miles. We had booked a sailing yacht for the whole of August, just the two of us, to go sailing in the deserted - due to Covid - Aegean. He was getting married in September, and this was meant to be our own, peculiar, spiritual, bachelor party. We would take with us our music, our books and our drugs. And we would sail where the wind took us. When August came, I decided to go ahead with the journey on my own. I nailed a picture of him, Fotis, on the cockpit and begun alone, though many friends wanted to come along. But I wanted no crew. I felt somewhat like Ahab beginning a doomed voyage. I thought I should spare any crew. I took with me 4 full discographies. Yours, Pink Floyd, Radiohead, and the greatest Greek of the 20th century, Savvopoulos. And two books, Moby Dick by Melville, and Odyssey by Homer. A week in the journey this happened. I was doing a long night sail. I always enjoy night sails. The wind was light and fair, no land or human in sight. No sound from an engine but the sails gently flapping in the wind, and the bow slowly advancing through the water. I was traversing a large stretch of water eastwards, from Mykonos to Patmos. The Milky Way was shining on top of me like a crown of all that has ever been. Ghosteen was on the speakers. I was having my coffee and my morning joint (you will hopefully not share this with the Hellenic coast guard!) all alone in the very first light. As the sun begun to break from the horizon (as I was travelling eastward), Galleon Ship entered. I stood there, all alone, watching a thousand-galleon ships sailing, &quot;ghostly around the morning sun.&quot; I broke down. I was overwhelmed. It brought me to my knees. I was kneeling in the cockpit, in the twilight, moving slowly towards the sun, crying my heart out. The closest to a prayer a non-believer can experience. And then of course, the way you have the album arranged, Ghosteen started speaking to me. I am beside you I am beside you Look for me Suddenly everything made sense. I could physically sense and see the Ghosteen. Everyone singing to be free, broke free. I could almost physically sense all that has ever been, and all that will ever be. Everything had somehow clicked in my head. Loss was okay. It was only part of the game. The beauty of it all came in the foreground. I rose up and smiled at the emerging sun. So I guess all I&#039;m trying to say is this: 1) I want you to know I can see and sense the Ghosteen. It will be with me forever. Until I close my eyes. 2) Thank you." />

<h1 class="post-title">Why are you playing in Israel?</h1>
<h3>POLIANA, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND</h3>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Dear Poliana,</p>
<p>Thank you for the many and varied letters you have sent to <em>The Red Hand Files</em>. They have not gone unnoticed, and it is always a pleasure to hear from you.</p>
<p>Personally, I think it would be a mistake not to have a baby because of Israel’s occupation of Palestine. I suspect in the long term you may live to regret that decision.</p>
<p>In my experience something can happen to a new parent, a perception shift, as they are absorbed into the strange and absolute universe of the child, where the problems of the outside world temporarily retreat. There can be, on a deep level, a radical softening of one’s adversarial or pessimistic position toward the world, as the baby reconfigures our understanding of it. Things look less grim.</p>
<p>This has certainly been the case for me. I would say that my own children have gone a long way toward amplifying and energising my understanding of the world’s potential. They have become bright windows through which I can imagine the world anew. Despite our perilous predicament, they have turned me into a cautious optimist, as I watch them go about making things better. There are many reasons people don’t have children, of course, but to choose not to have them as a reaction to the state of the world seems, to me, defeatist and sad.</p>
<p>As for your question on Israel, I will refer you to Issue #13 where I lay out my reasons for playing Israel — no need to do that again here, they’ve changed little. I can assure you, though, that there is no censorship of questions relating to Israel on my website, and this will be evidenced by the usual cascade of letters I will receive from the boycott advocates, after posting this Issue.</p>
<p>However, let me just say this. My music is not designed to reward people for good behaviour, nor do I make music to punish people for bad behaviour. My music is not conditional. It is for everybody, regardless of their actions, good or bad or otherwise. I hope my music has the capacity to advance the world in a positive direction. I say <em>my</em> music because I believe each musician should be afforded the respect to arrive at their own understanding of what the exact purpose of their music is. I make music in the hope that it improves matters, that it makes things better. Poliana, how I wish I could walk on stage again in front of an <em>actual crowd,</em> in Israel, or in New Zealand or anywhere else, and play — what an absolute privilege that would be.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

					<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Richard,</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Yes, I do have an interest in magic, or at least I used to. My boy, Arthur, became obsessed with it when he was about thirteen and for a year, maybe more, <em>all </em>he did was magic. Every day he sat around shuffling cards and flipping coins, and watching endless online magic tutorials and DVDs by his favourite magicians. He joined The Young Magicians Club at The Magic Circle and I would drive him around to magic shows and magician</span><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">’</span><span lang="EN-US">s conventions and trade shows and magic shops. He practised and practised and became really good at it.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">In the summer of 2014, in Los Angeles, we spent much of our time down on Hollywood Blvd watching the street magicians, and Arthur would show them his magic tricks and they would show him theirs. We hung out at the Magic Castle every Saturday that summer, and entered this strange community of magicians, who taught Arthur the Classic Pass and the Double Turnover and the various coin tricks, and Arthur got so good at sleight of hand it seemed that there was nothing he couldn</span><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">’</span><span lang="EN-US">t make disappear. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Our dear friend Larry </span><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">‘</span>Ratso<span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA"> ’</span><span lang="EN-US">Sloman, who wrote the definitive book on Harry Houdini, introduced us to the great David Blaine — we went to his house and Arthur showed him a couple of his tricks and David called Arthur </span><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">‘</span><span lang="EN-US">a good magician</span><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">’</span><span lang="EN-US">, then took out a deck of cards and completely blew our minds. Later on he gave Arthur the novel, Siddhartha, by Hermann Hesse, which Arthur never read, but kept next to his bed. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Then one day, back in Brighton, Arthur just stopped doing magic completely. I asked him why and he just shrugged and said, </span><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">“</span><span lang="EN-US">I don</span><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">’</span><span lang="EN-US">t want to do it any more, dad</span>”<span lang="EN-US">, and that was the end of that — and, I suppose, the end of my active interest in magic, too.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Richard, I hope I</span><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">’</span><span lang="EN-US">ve answered your question. I am sorry that maybe in the end these words are not addressed to you. Maybe these words are projected beyond this world, as a wish, as a prayer, as a sleight of hand, hoping they may draw the attention of the spirits themselves. Our boy, our magician, our vanisher — we miss you.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="NL">Love, Nick</span></p>

					<p><span lang="EN-US">Dear Tim,</span></p>
<div>
<div></div>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Freedom for me is the ability to relinquish control of the outcome of things and so, in this respect, I agree with Nina Simone; it is to be delivered from fear. These are fraught times but, for me, meditation, the loss of my son, and even the fact that I am just getting older, has allowed me to arrive at a place where I do not feel at the mercy of consequence in the way that I used to — it doesn’t matter to me so much these days <em>what happens</em>. I feel that if I stay true to myself and follow my intuitions, if I surrender control of life’s outcomes, things tend to work out okay. On an artistic level, I play what I want to play, and say what I want to say, and let the chips fall where they may. This is a kind of freedom. As I have said before in </span><em><span lang="DE">The Red Hand Files</span></em><span lang="EN-US">, the universe has had its best shot at me and I am still kicking around. </span><em><span lang="DE">The Red Hand Files</span></em><span lang="EN-US"> have played a significant part in this feeling of resilience to the capricious and indifferent nature of the world, they have made me stronger. Each answer I write seems to be an act of surrender, but at the same time a kind of armouring up — vulnerability as a form of protection. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Tim, your question, that came in today, was the 30,000<sup>th</sup> one. It is also two years this week since I started <em>The Red Hand Files</em> and I can’t tell you how much this means to me. On top of that, this week was my lovely wife’s birthday and also the funeral of my dear, dear mother. Thank you to the many people who offered their condolences at the loss of my mother and reminded me, over and over again, of her beautiful words — </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">“Head high and fuck ‘</span>em all!<span lang="EN-US">” </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">She was the greatest. </span></p>

<p>Dear Tom,</p>
<p>An anchor without a ship is just a useless lump of iron that lies at the bottom of the sea. An anchor serves no purpose once the ship has set sail.</p>
<p>In my song ‘Waiting for You’ I wrote —</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>Your body is my anchor</p>
<p>I never asked to be freed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>— and even though the context is different I understand the painful place you are in and I in no way want to diminish it, however, your current state is ultimately unsustainable and, well, seeing as we are dealing in metaphors there is no reason we can’t at least entertain the possibility that you might be a ship that just thinks it is an anchor.</p>
<p>The revealing part of your question is the last few words “burdened by the weight of <em>having been used</em>”. If you continue to see yourself in this self-defeating light, whether it is true or not, you will remain that twisted lump of metal at the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p>My wish for you, my friend — and all the other abandoned anchors that write to me from the ocean floor — is that a time will come when you can reimagine yourself, not as the poor old stalwart anchor rusting on the sea bottom, but as a fucking ship and get back on the surface of the water and do what ships do — venture forth and begin again the strange, dangerous, <em>glorious,</em> storm-tossed voyage of life!</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

					<div>
<p>Dear Scott,</p>
<p>About thirty years ago, when Dirty Three were still playing the little clubs in Melbourne, Conway Savage, who was the newly appointed piano player in the Bad Seeds, was in the audience watching the band. He had not seen Dirty Three before, nor had he met Warren. In the song ‘Indian Love Song’ Warren played the flute.</p>
<p>Now, you must understand that Conway was a guy from an obscure town in rural Victoria called Fish Creek with a population of about ninety people and, at the time, his musical taste didn’t extend too far beyond traditional country and western music.</p>
<p>Conway introduced himself to Warren after the gig saying — “Good show, mate, but if I see you play that flute again I’ll ram it up your arse.”</p>
<p>So, Warren quietly put his flute away in its case and there it lay, untouched, for over a decade.</p>
<p>It’s 2004 and The Bad Seeds are in Ferber studios in Paris for the Abattoir Blues sessions. Warren is now in the band and we had just recorded the song ‘Breathless’, an upbeat number that begins —</p>
</div>
<pre><em>
It’s up in the morning and on the downs</em>

<em>Little white clouds like gambolling lambs</em>


</pre>
<div>
<p>Conway had done some lovely rollicking piano on it and gone back to the hotel.I felt that the song needed a solo instrument on the opening bars, so that the song began in a happy, life-affirming way, so I say to Warren — “Have you got a flute?”</p>
<p>Warren says — “Um, yes.”</p>
<p>I say — “I think this song needs some flute. Let’s put some on tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Warren says — “Well, we’d better do it in the morning before Conway comes in because he told me years ago that if I ever played the flute again he would ram it up my arse.”</p>
<p>So, the next day I set up a space for Warren to play the flute — a meditation cushion and a circle of scented candles and some incense and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Warren arrives with his flute and says — “Is Conway here?”</p>
<p>And I say — “No.”</p>
<p>So, Warren sits down on the cushion and we bring the lights down, put on ‘Breathless’, and Warren plays the flute on the introduction. Now, Warren hasn’t played the flute since Conway said he’d stick it up his arse, so Warren is more than a bit rusty and the flute sounds like shit. So we do it again.</p>
<p>I say to him — “Relax and play like a seven year old child that has just been given his first recorder.”</p>
<p>So Warren plays it again and it still sounds terrible. “Give me another go,” he says.</p>
<p>So Warren does, like, another ten takes and they each sound progressively worse than the one before. Warren does the Walk of Shame back into the control booth.</p>
<p>“The flute sounds like shit,” I say to Warren.</p>
<p>“Right,” says Warren.</p>
<p>“How about we listen to them all back at the same time,” I say.</p>
<p>Warren says — “And let’s put some of them backwards.”</p>
<p>And I say — “And let’s detune some of them and stick them through a phaser, and drench the whole thing in reverb.”</p>
<p>So, Nick Launay, the producer, messes around with the flute, and then plays all the takes back at the same time — some backwards, some detuned, some phased — and it sounds like an incredibly fucked-up 14<sup>th</sup> or 16<sup>th</sup> Century style ensemble, as you say, Scott. Warren has a big smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Beautiful,” he says.</p>
<p>Then Conway comes in.</p>
<p>Conway sits down, lights a cigarette, opens a beer, listens for a bit and says — “Is that a flute?”</p>
<p>Warren says in a small voice — “No.”</p>
<p>May 2017 and we are in Brooklyn for rehearsals for the American <em>Skeleton Tree</em> tour. Conway collapses in the lobby of the One Hotel and is rushed to hospital, where he undergoes emergency surgery to remove a tumour from his brain. Conway remains in hospital and we head off on tour without him.</p>
<p>After the tour, there is a letter waiting for Warren back home in Paris. The letter reads —</p>
<p>“Warren, I was wrong about the flute. Conway.”</p>
<p>Though Conway’s operation was a success, it was a short reprieve — Conway would never tour with the Bad Seeds again and a year later, on this day in 2018, Conway passed away taking the ramshackle soul of the Bad Seeds with him.</p>
<p>People often ask me if I miss past members of the Bad Seeds and the answer is, ‘Well, not really.’ But I miss Conway. We all miss Conway. We miss him a lot. Things are not the same without him.</p>
<p>Just as an aside. Back in 2004, we released Breathless as a single, but the BBC radio refused to play it. They loved the song but they didn’t like the flute. Our record company at the time recalled the song and removed the flute. The BBC played it. It was a flop.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

<h1 class="post-title">How are you going to pick one of the covers? I think they&#8217;re all terrific. What trouble have you got into, dear Nick?</h1>
<h3>NATASHA, BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA</h3>
</div>
<div>

<p>Dear Natasha and Kathy,I was absolutely blown away. Seriously. The cover versions were awesome. Many of them, as far as I am concerned, were glorious advancements on the originals. Maria Højrup’s gorgeous Bright Horses, the operatic Avalanche, Saint Agnes’ chilling and superior No Pussy Blues and Asa’s Loverman-riot, the absolutely epic Galleon Ship and the super-disturbing Jack the Ripper, that seriously great Higgs Boson Blues from Ladyship Warship — wow, the rendition of Wild Rose (finally in tune), and the beautiful Covid-harp version, the Watching Alice snuff video, Paul at the piano playing Push the Sky Away, the kid singing We No Who U R on the acoustic guitar in the Clash t-shirt, and many other lovely versions of this song, the truly celestial Girl in Amber — so beautiful,  the cool aborted country version of Loverman, the couple singing Henry Lee in Italian, the woman singing a weird and wonderful Far From Me, the Kubrick/Clément West Country Girl, the consistently exquisite genius of Gelareh Pour — we are simply not worthy, my dear, and poor Woody still in the bath, the cutest duet of People Ain’t No Good ever, the guy in his kitchen in his socks playing a radically lovely interpretation of O Children and Nick and Yana’s super-eerie version of the same song, the deeply enchanting I Let Love In and the full-on version, the brilliantly evil Up Jumped the Devil, the Dead Writers’ astonishing Are You the One That I’ve Been Waiting For? and the instrumental version, the lovely Stranger Than Kindness dance-with-the–devil-mini-movie, the girl playing the joyful, kamikaze version of Good, Good Day — a personal favourite, the girl singing Henry Lee with the flowers in her hair, the handsome guys playing More News from Nowhere in their shed, the Serbian ukulele Mercy Seat, the sultry Shivers, the unbelievably brave version of From Her to Eternity from the girl sitting on the floor, Jake Shane who takes Fireflies and totally claims it as his own, Tom Rabu’s superlative, amputated We No Who U R and Jubilee Street instrumental — my God!, and the epic guitar version of the same song, the hard rock Fifteen Feet of Pure White Snow, complete with Moog synthesizer solo, the loneliest and most sublime No More Shall We Part ever,  the country Love Letter, the many gorgeous Into My Arms, the cool kid playing O Children on the unplugged electric guitar, the hysterical Lay Me Low, the devotional Bless His Ever Loving Heart, Straight to You in a gold cape, the girl singing an unearthly reworking of Skeleton Tree and Till Otte’s chilling version of the same song, the dreamy Push the Sky Away, the awesome Swedish Mercy Seat, the seriously pissed-off, wigged-out Christina the Astonishing, the satanic Song of Joy, a whole bunch of different people finally doing something cool with Red Right Hand, including PJ Brown and the D minor matchbox girl, and Ptolemy, of course, the goose-bumpy version of Hold Onto Yourself — a song I haven’t heard for years, the joyous Brompton Oratory trio, the mighty Sadegh’s Palaces of Montezuma and the funky version and the version in the club, the two girls’ well-needed reworking of The Weeping Song and The Weeping Song in a room of lights, the wonderful Cleopatra  Weeping Song, the baptismal Weeping Song, and all the other Weeping Songs, the spooked-out Man in the Moon, the crystalline, heart-stopping Sun Forest, the intense Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!, the punk-rock Idiot Prayer in a hazmat suit, Scott Casuccio’s ethereal voice, the acapella Push the Sky Away, the guy fucking going for it with O My Lord, the live Ship Song, the Loom of the Land duet, the nervy ‘solo’ Stagger Lee, Tino pouring his heart out, the groovy Lime Tree Arbour, the gorgeous candle-lit No More Shall We Part, the eerie version at the piano, and the super-groovy and drugged-out Messiah Ward, Herbert’s Wonderful Life, Joel’s awesome, other-worldly speak-song version of I had a Dream, Joe, the father singing Waiting For You with his son — Jesus, I wasn’t prepared for that — and then the girl playing it on the upright — wow, the fucked-up Nick the Stripper with the horse’s head, the wild version of Brother My Cup is Empty from Buenos Aires, the lovely God is in the House from Luiz Rocha, and on and on it went.</p>
<p>But there were two songs, both off Ghosteen that, for me, stopped time itself. The deeply moving version of Spinning Song by Ilya Gruzdev, with its extraordinarily affecting home video footage, was such a strange, bold and emotional elevation of the original. I loved this. Watching it, well, it was very hard for me to keep my shit together.</p>
<p>And the other song, Waiting For You by Juldiz, with its incredibly haunting video, felt like it was attached by the tips of its fingers to the very edge of the world and could float away at any moment. It really was one of the most beautiful and precarious musical moments I have heard in a very long time. It was a performance that emerged deep within the song itself, on that delicious brink of collapse where so much great art lives, beamed from a million sorrowing miles away. Unbelievably beautiful.</p>
<p>Like I said, I was very affected by what I saw this weekend. We all were, I think, based on the love and support from the Bad Seed community in the comments section of the Vortex. There have been a lot of cover versions of my songs over the years, but rarely have I heard them played with such honesty, understanding, creativity, conviction and pure heart. This stuff is the real deal and exactly what music should be about. Thank you all so much. It was an honour to be a part of it.</p>
<div>Love, Nick</div>

					<p>Dear Nic,</p>
<p>This is so good. The band are great. I love the slow crawl of the song, the backing vocals coming in half way, and everything kicking in at 3:15. Genuinely thrilling.</p>
<p>And Tyler’s writing is something else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>‘The wolf who wins?</em></p>
<p><em>The one you feed’</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>— is about as smart and as true as something can be, and the final verse</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&#8216;Playing on my heartstrings</em></p>
<p><em>You never pour your picky jealousy</em></p>
<p><em>Onto my growing love for you</em></p>
<p><em>Help me beat my way to you&#8217;</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>— is as good as it gets. That last line!</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>‘Help me beat my way to you’</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

<h1 class="post-title">What do you think of cancel culture?</h1>
<h3>FRANCES, LOS ANGELES, USA</h3>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Dear Valerio and Frances,</p>
<p>Mercy is a value that should be at the heart of any functioning and tolerant society. Mercy ultimately acknowledges that we are all imperfect and in doing so allows us the oxygen to breathe — to feel protected within a society, through our mutual fallibility. Without mercy a society loses its soul, and devours itself.</p>
<p>Mercy allows us the ability to engage openly in free-ranging conversation — an expansion of collective discovery toward a common good. If mercy is our guide we have a safety net of mutual consideration, and we can, to quote Oscar Wilde, “play gracefully with ideas.”</p>
<p>Yet mercy is not a given. It is a value we must nurture and aspire to. Tolerance allows the spirit of enquiry the confidence to roam freely, to make mistakes, to self-correct, to be bold, to dare to doubt and in the process to chance upon new and more advanced ideas. Without mercy society grows inflexible, fearful, vindictive and humourless.</p>
<p>Frances, you’ve asked about cancel culture. As far as I can see, cancel culture is mercy’s antithesis. Political correctness has grown to become the unhappiest religion in the world. Its once honourable attempt to reimagine our society in a more equitable way now embodies all the worst aspects that religion has to offer (and none of the beauty) — moral certainty and self-righteousness shorn even of the capacity for redemption. It has become quite literally, bad religion run amuck.</p>
<p>Cancel culture’s refusal to engage with uncomfortable ideas has an asphyxiating effect on the creative soul of a society. Compassion is the primary experience — the heart event — out of which emerges the genius and generosity of the imagination. Creativity is an act of love that can knock up against our most foundational beliefs, and in doing so brings forth fresh ways of seeing the world. This is both the function and glory of art and ideas. A force that finds its meaning in the cancellation of these difficult ideas hampers the creative spirit of a society and strikes at the complex and diverse nature of its culture.</p>
<p>But this is where we are. We are a culture in transition, and it may be that we are heading toward a more equal society — I don’t know — but what essential values will we forfeit in the process?</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

					<p>Dear Marko,</p>
<p>In my experience, lyrics are almost always seemingly <em>just not coming</em>. This is the tearful ground zero of song writing — at least for some of us. This lack of motion, this sense of suspended powerlessness, can feel extraordinarily desperate for a songwriter. But the thing you must hold on to through these difficult periods, as hard as it may be, is this — <em>when something’s not coming, it’s coming</em>. It took me many years to learn this, and to this day I have trouble remembering it.</p>
<p>The idea of lyrics ‘not coming’ is basically a category error. What we are talking about is not a period of ‘not coming’ but a period of ‘not arriving’. The lyrics are always coming. They are always pending. They are always on their way toward us. But often they must journey a great distance and over vast stretches of time to get there. They advance through the rugged terrains of lived experience, battling to arrive at the end of our pen. In time, they emerge, leaping free of the unknown — from memory or, more thrillingly, from the predictive part of our minds that exists on the far side of the lived moment. It has been a long and arduous journey, and our waiting much anguished.</p>
<p>Marko, our task is both simple and extremely difficult. Our task is to remain patient and vigilant and to not lose heart — for we are the destination. We are the portals from which the idea explodes, forced forth by its yearning to arrive. We are the revelators, the living instruments through which the idea announces itself — the flourishing and the blooming — but we are also the waiting and the wondering and the worrying. We are all of these things — we are the songwriters.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

					<div>Dear All,</p>
<p>It seems that there are a number of crowdfunding campaigns being set up by some fans to buy me a Fazioli. While this is incredibly thoughtful and I really appreciate the lengths people are going to to secure me this lovely instrument, it is entirely unnecessary. As Mike from Birmingham says, “Why don’t you just buy your own fucking piano, you cheap c**t.” Mike is right, God bless him, I really should just buy my own piano.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p></div>

<p>Dear All,</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>It seems that some of my fans have reacted a little enthusiastically to my last Red Hand File and have contacted Fazioli ‘encouraging’ them to gift me a piano. While I appreciate the gesture, my post was a light-hearted piece and not to be taken seriously. The phone dialogue between my manager and the ‘woman from Fazioli’ was more than a little embellished for comic effect.</p>
<p>The tsunami of mail has left our friends at Fazioli a little shaken, so while I love you all &#8211; no more mails to Fazioli please! They are wonderful people.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

<p>Dear Andrew,</p>
<p>The piano I played at Alexandra Palace was a Fazioli. There were limited pianos I could access during lockdown. There was, however, a Fazioli. I had never played one before but Dom Monks, the guy who recorded the Alexandra Palace performance, highly recommended this piano. The moment I sat down at the Fazioli, its warm, soft, nuanced sound spoke to me like no piano had spoken to me before. I was swept away by its extraordinary tonal range. It whispered to me. It roared at me. It was the most beautiful instrument I had ever played.</p>
<p>On a Zoom call to my manager I mentioned how much I loved the Fazioli. I reminded him that I still have the same nasty little Chinese upright I have had for over thirty years. I explained that I was sixty-three years old and suggested that perhaps it was time I got a nice piano. I said to my manager — I just love that Fazioli.</p>
<p>Now, one of the things you may or may not know about being a famous musician is that companies give you shit for free. The more famous you are, the more shit you get — you just have to wear one of their t-shirts or a branded cap or something. Being the principled individual that I am, of course, I have never sponsored a musical instrument (in that respect, I am virtually alone in my field) but I just loved that Fazioli.</p>
<p>So I said to my manager — Time to sell my soul. Time to make a call and get me a Fazioli.</p>
<p>My manager said — Consider it done!</p>
<p>So, the next day my manager rings up Fazioli, who have their headquarters in Sacile, in the Province of Pordenone, near Venice and an Italian woman answers the phone.</p>
<p>My manager says — I represent the great artist Nick Cave and I am wondering if I could get a free Fazioli (or something like that).</p>
<p>The Italian woman says — L’acttore?</p>
<p>My manager says — What?</p>
<p>She says — The actor?</p>
<p>My manager says — No, Cave. <em>Cave.</em></p>
<p>And she says — Nick what?</p>
<p>My manager says — Nick Cave.</p>
<p>She says — Nick Cave? Who issa Nick Cave?</p>
<p>My manager says — Well, he is arguably the greatest songwriter of his time. He is one of the cornerstones of modern music. He is a national treasure. He is adored by millions. <em>Italians</em> love him.</p>
<p>She says — Who are you? What you want?</p>
<p>My manager says — Um, a free piano.</p>
<p>And she hangs up.</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<p>* * * *</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>A couple of days later I’m on another Zoom call with my manager, and he is looking a bit cagey and I say — How did it go with Fazioli? Did you get me a free Fazioli?</p>
<p>And my manager says — Well, it seems like they have a rather inflexible policy around giving away £200,000 pianos to people they’ve never heard of.</p>
<p>And I say — Dude, are you my fucking manager or what? I just love that Fazioli!</p>
<p>So the next day my manager rings back Fazioli and the same woman answers the phone and my manager says — Look it’s Nick Cave’s manager again, can I speak to Mr Fazioli.</p>
<p>And the woman says — No.</p>
<p>And my manager says — Listen, my fucking <em>job’s</em> on the line here.</p>
<p>And she hangs up.</p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: center;">* * * *</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>So, Andrew, I agree — the Fazioli is a glorious piano. Magnificent, as you say. As Herbie Hancock said about <em>his </em>Fazioli — that ‘one note announces the celebration of the freedom and creativity of the human spirit’. This is true. The Fazioli is warm and delicate and remarkably subtle, but has a deep, strong heart. It is full of angel tears and <em>il sangue dei santi</em> and encompasses the universe. It is a dream piano.And yet I wait for the day a giant removal van will pull up outside my house, my manager hanging out the passenger window, wearing a t-shirt with a piano on it, and a big smile on his face, screaming ‘Fazioli!’</p>
<p>Until then my little Chinese upright grins at me from the corner of my room. I walk over and sit down and I begin to play.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

It was a gentle passing. Now shapes and echoes resound. I feel a presence that comes and goes - a comforting presence, gentle and protective. I don&#039;t understand it. I don&#039;t believe in a god that sits above. I feel a presence in all things - something mysterious and miraculous. Sometimes I gaze gently at birds and trees and am deeply moved by the life that hums in them. For I love birds and trees especially the sparrows and tall trees with wide branches. It&#039;s strange to feel so connected and yet have a feeling of being so disconnected. At times I&#039;m fine - more than fine as they are here and I forget I lost them and my memories hold the space of all things we shared. My question is I don&#039;t know how to understand the experience of loss. It&#039;s not something I could negotiate with. I hope this makes some sense. : The Red Hand Files</title>

					<p><span lang="EN-US">Dear Rose, </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">I have printed your letter in full as it describes very beautifully the experience of inhabiting the uncanny and disorientating realm of loss. Thank you for taking such care with it.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">The paradoxical effect of losing a loved one is that their sudden absence can become a feverish comment on <em>that which remains</em>. That which remains rises in time from the dark with a burning physicality — a luminous super-presence — as we acquaint ourselves with this new </span><span lang="EN-US">and different world</span><span lang="EN-US">. In loss things &#8211; both animate and inanimate &#8211; take on an added intensity and meaning. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">I love your line —</span><br />
<em><span lang="EN-US">‘Sometimes I gaze gently at birds and trees and am deeply moved by the life that hums in them</span></em><span lang="EN-US">.’</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">I think this feeling you describe, of alertness to the inner-spirit of things — this humming — comes from a hard-earned understanding of the impermanence of things and, indeed, our own impermanence. This lesson ultimately animates and illuminates our lives. We become witnesses to the thrilling emergency of the present — a series of exquisite and burning moments, each extinguished as the next arises. These magical moments are the bright jewels of loss to which we cling. They are your <em>‘sparrows and tall trees with wide branches.’</em></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">For there is, of course, another side where we lose our resolve — we drop our guard, or just grow tired and descend into that other, darker, less-lovely world, as we disconnect and retreat deep into ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Rose, these revolving feelings of connection and disconnection you describe so well are the opposing forces of loss that define our lived experience. Letters like yours make a great difference because many of us inhabit this uncanny realm of loss — and <em>all </em>of us will find our way there in time.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Love, Nick</span></p>

					<p class="Body">Dear Layla,</p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Much of my creative energy comes from a focused exchange of ideas with other people — I would call that the </span><em><span lang="IT">collaborative spirit</span></em><span lang="EN-US">. The collaborative spirit is essentially a strategy for responding to the world. In this respect <em>The Red Hand Files </em>are a collaboration, and it is the received energy from the ever-growing number of questions that brings me back each week to this place of acknowledgement and gratitude. It feels like a shared project. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">So it is with Susie. I have been married to her for over twenty years, and our marriage itself is an ever-evolving alliance or collaboration. The work that we do — Susie with <em>The Vampire</em></span><em><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">’</span></em><em><span lang="DE">s Wife,</span></em><span lang="EN-US"> and me with my own work — is a form of self-actualising that emerges from the energy of our relationship. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">It is not that I discuss my lyrics with her, rather my lyrics radiate from a life lived together. My words are not just a way of making sense of our relationship, they also participate in it, magnify it, and enhance it. It is the same with Susie</span><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">’</span><span lang="EN-US">s dresses. They are ghost-like articulations of the mysterious and preternatural part of her nature, as seen through our relationship. The designing and creating of these dresses, like the writing of my words, emerge out of our shared experience; and these creative endeavours, these songs and dresses, in turn, </span><em>imagine</em><span lang="EN-US"> our relationship alive — and around and around it goes, each dreaming up the other.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">These days, there is little I do that is not done in the spirit of collaboration. We are drawn together at the behest of the world to attend to its needs. This world itself is our communal experiment — all of ours — a shared project of extraordinary complexity in which we are all participating, and through which each of our actions resound through time. We each impact upon the other, and are each in service of the other. </span><span lang="EN-US">This is the true energy of the collaborative spirit.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="NL">Love, Nick</span></p>

					<p>Dear Damian,</p>
<p>In 1972 Nina Simone released a live album entitled Emergency Ward! that was, by her own admission, her oppositional response to the Vietnam War. This record begins with an eighteen-minute rendition of ‘My Sweet Lord’, that could well be her greatest musical achievement. Nina Simone’s interpretation of George Harrison’s gentle cosmic entreaty ends up, in her hands, as a howl of spiritual abandonment and accusation.</p>
<p>The song begins with a thirty-second chant of —</p>
<p><em>We want Nina!</em></p>
<p><em>We want Nina!</em></p>
<p>before the band launches into a raucous reanimation of the George Harrison classic. Nina’s entry couldn’t be more casual, inside the manic energy of the song —</p>
<p><em>Oh my Lord</em></p>
<p><em>My sweet Lord</em></p>
<p>This rendition is a gospel thrill ride, with mantras, wild syncopated handclaps and weird background whoops, courtesy of the Bethany Baptist Church Junior Choir of South Jamaica, New York. The Hare Krishna chant has been removed and more ‘Hallelujahs’ have been added as Nina reaches back to her Methodist roots and proclaims —</p>
<p><em>I really want to see you, Lord</em></p>
<p><em>But it takes so long</em></p>
<p>And further on —</p>
<p><em>The world is looking for you</em></p>
<p><em>Won’t you show yourself, Lord?</em></p>
<p>then surges back in, each time with increased abandon. At around six minutes there is an exquisite breakdown and Nina’s plea grows more pressing —</p>
<p><em>I really want to see you</em></p>
<p><em>I really need to see you</em></p>
<p><em>But everything today is a killer</em></p>
<p><em>Today is a killer</em></p>
<p><em>Today is a killer</em></p>
<p><em>How am I gonna see you?</em></p>
<p><em>Nobody has taught us any patience, Lord</em></p>
<p><em>And now it is too late, too late, my Lord</em></p>
<p>And yet again the song storms back in, the sense of cosmic desertion growing stronger and stronger. Each breakdown, each entreaty, each surge becomes more fraught, as if the whole world is fracturing and collapsing around Nina’s petitions.</p>
<p>At twelve minutes Nina incorporates a poem by David Nelson of The Last Poets and the song falls into a kind of weird reverie —</p>
<p><em>I often sit there in the sea</em></p>
<p><em>And dream dreams</em></p>
<p><em>And hope hopes</em></p>
<p><em>And wish wishes</em></p>
<p><em>And I listen to the wind song</em></p>
<p><em>As it dances a beautiful dance for me</em></p>
<p><em>But these moments never last long…</em></p>
<p>And there is a further rupturing of the narrative as Nina drags us into the sudden horror of the historical moment, with lines like —</p>
<p><em>Comes the reality of today</em></p>
<p><em>Grinning its all-knowing, fiendish grin</em></p>
<p><em>Pressing his ugly face against mine</em></p>
<p><em>Staring at me with lifeless eyes</em></p>
<p><em>Crumbling away all memories of yesterday’s dreams</em></p>
<p><em>Because today is a killer</em></p>
<p><em>And only you can save us, Lord</em></p>
<p>Nina still beseeching, still calling into the vacuum —</p>
<p><em>I certainly never hoped</em></p>
<p><em>That one day I&#8217;d be screaming</em></p>
<p><em>Something my mother told me I needed</em></p>
<p><em>In the beginning</em></p>
<p><em>In the beginning</em></p>
<p><em>In the beginning</em></p>
<p>and then a long held note, an ululation cast into the roaring void, as her meditation turns finally, to condemn the indifferent heavens and her ‘sweet Lord’ for his ultimate betrayal —</p>
<p><em>Today, where are you, Lord?</em></p>
<p><strong><em>YOU ARE A KILLER!</em></strong></p>
<p>The great Nina Simone was a living grievance machine — her race, her gender, her misused talents (she wanted to be a classical pianist) — and this rage infused all her work, and is what makes it so multi-layered. Even her most beautiful love songs, which I count as some of the most incandescent works of art ever recorded, were marinated in a sense of resentment and contempt for the workings of the world. It is this exhilarating collision of opposing forces — love and scorn — that makes Nina Simone’s existential and political protestations so compelling.</p>
<p>In this extraordinarily bold statement, Nina Simone stands defiant in the face of spiritual oblivion, and a world (and God) that so readily allows war and senseless carnage to occur. It is a protest song par excellence that serves as a form of transport, a vehicle that takes us on a complex and nuanced journey into transcendent rage. The song itself becomes a forge of fury, where Nina Simone stands conflicted and defiant and, in the final lines, pulls the heavens crashing down around our ears.</p>
<p>Perhaps, this is the voice of protest we need right now — intelligent, questing, transcendent, raging and thrillingly complex —</p>
<p><em>We want Nina!</em></p>
<p><em>We want Nina!</em></p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

<h1 class="post-title">What is love for you?</h1>
<h3>PABLO, GUARDAMA DEL SEGURA, SPAIN</h3>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Dear Tom and Pablo,</p>
<p>The voice in ‘Ghosteen Speaks’ is not my own. It is the emergent expression of an invisible, migratory spirit — the <em>Ghosteen</em>. It is the spirit of love and mercy. Throughout the song, the Ghosteen announces its presence — <em>I am beside you. Look for me.</em></p>
<p>It says — <em>I am invisible, but I am here. Search for me, and you will find me.</em></p>
<p>It calls to the compassionate act of witnessing — of seeing.</p>
<p>Love has something to do with the notion of being seen — the opposite of invisibility. The invisible, the unwitnessed, the unacknowledged, the isolated, the lonely — these are the unloved. Loving attention illuminates the unseen, escorting them from the frontiers of lovelessness into the observed world. To truly see someone — anyone — is an act that acknowledges and forgives our common and imperfect humanity. Love enacts a kind of vigilant perception — whether it is to a partner, a child, a co-worker, a neighbour, a fellow citizen, or any other person one may encounter in this life. Love says softly — <em>I see you. I recognise you. You are human, as am I.</em></p>
<p>To pay witness to another, in an alert and loving manner, is essentially an act of forgiveness for it is to acknowledge with compassion our mutual human capacity for <em>all</em> things, both good and evil.</p>
<p>When we reduce each other to symbols or representations, rather than see each other as the complex, flawed human beings that we are, we engage in the very antithesis of mercy — heartlessness, condemnation and sanctimoniousness. Within this baleful clamour the luminous spirits of compassion retreat.</p>
<p><em>I am beside you. Look for me </em>— call the windswept voices of love, to all that have the forbearance to hear.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

<p>Dear JP,</p>
<p>Perhaps the thing you enjoy about my songs is that they are conflicted, and often deal in uncertainties and ambiguities. My better songs seem to be engaged in an interior struggle between opposing outlooks or states of mind. They rarely settle on anything. My songs sit in that liminal space between decided points of view.</p>
<p>Songs with political agendas inhabit a different space. They have little patience for nuance, neutrality or impartiality. Their aim is to get the message across in as clear and persuasive a manner as possible. There can be great value in these sorts of songs, but they are usually born from a particular combination of rigidity and zealousness, which I personally do not possess. My songs seem to be resistant to fixed, inflexible points of view. They have, as you say, a concern for common, non-hierarchical suffering. They are not in the business of saving the world; rather they are in the business of saving <em>the soul</em> of the world.</p>
<p>Sometimes my songs speak into the current situation and sometimes they do not. I am mostly happy with that. I am happy that people can come to my songs and — even though they may be challenging or confronting — they do not preach and do not divide, and are offered to everyone, without exception.</p>
<p>I have very little control over what songs I write. They are constructed, incrementally, in the smallest of ways, the greater meaning revealing itself after the fact. They are often slippery, amorphous things, with unclear trajectories — position-free attempts at understanding the mysteries of the heart. I guess I could write a protest song, but I think I would, in the end, feel compromised in doing so, not because there aren’t things I am fundamentally opposed to — there are — but because I would be using my particular talents to deal with something I consider to be morally obvious. Personally, I have little inclination to do that. It’s just not what I do.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

					<p>Dear Victoria,</p>
<p>Normally, to answer this question I would simply go to my bookshelves and choose forty books. However, my bookshelves are completely empty. The 5000+ books I have accumulated over the years have been shipped to the Royal Danish Library in Copenhagen. They are now part of the completely mind-blowing, heart-stopping Stranger Than Kindness exhibition. Without my library in front of me it is a little difficult to assemble a comprehensive list of my forty most loved books. The best I can do is throw together a rather formless and incoherent grab bag of titles that come to mind at this moment that, for one reason or another, I have loved over the years. I think I got carried away. I think there are fifty — in no particular order.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

<h1 class="post-title">What do you personally look for in an artist?</h1>
<h3>MAX, HAMBURG, GERMANY</h3>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Dear Eleonora and Max,</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">I think that for some of us it is almost impossible to have a cohesive identity or, rather, there are some whose inconsistent and conflicted sense of self <em>is </em>their identity. There are those who have an identity that is contrary and evolving and forever at war with itself. It is perpetually in the process of challenging its own best ideas. Once an idea of self — a stance, a point of view, an identity — is settled upon, this inner subversive begins the business of dismantling it. Yet, this resistance to a fixed identity could be our greatest strength.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Perhaps I inherited this tendency from my father, who had, to say the least, a perverse and contrary view of the world, or maybe it is because I was born between star signs, or it could just be the old boomer in me that continues to have a nostalgic fondness for disruption and chaos, but I have forever felt a horror of being boxed in by an identity and an inflexible opinion, for this allegiance to a single personae can be the very death of creativity.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Maybe, Eleonora, there is some advantage in not having those ‘bits fit together’. This lack of cohesion prevents us from being enslaved by absolutes — what is true and what is not true, what is the right way to be and what is the wrong way to be — and affords us the ability to embrace contradictory ideas at the same time. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">For an artist, particularly a songwriter, this ability to be open to influence, to discard personae, gives us the freedom to express ourselves in contrasting ways. When I think about the artists who have had the greatest impact on me, this fluctuating and disordered identity, and necessity to reinvent themselves, is common to most of them. I think this is what I look for in an artist — the ability to change, and to grow, and to confound.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Love, Nick</span></p>

<h3>PAUL, PORTLAND, USA</h3>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Mark and Paul,</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">The poet David Whyte wrote, </span>“<span lang="EN-US">The fear of loss is the motivator behind all conscious and unconscious dishonesties.</span>” <span lang="EN-US">I found there to be so much truth in these words. After my son died and I eventually stepped from the darkness back into the world, I brought with me a gift that I feel I am only beginning to understand. </span>“<span lang="EN-US">The gauntlet with a gift in it,</span>” <span lang="EN-US">as Elizabeth Barrett Browning so beautifully wrote. I felt that my family and I had been tested and that we had survived, and this gift that I carried was the freedom to be honest with myself and with others — as there was nothing left to conceal. The protective shell that I had constructed around myself, my old life, had been torn away. I had been exposed, and I had nothing left to defend. The gift in the gauntlet was a new and raw honesty toward myself and toward the world.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Because, you see, the world had done its worst. What harm was left to be done? What remained to fear? What was left to lose that I could not survive? I felt extraordinarily liberated by this, protected by the calamity itself and perversely invincible within my own vulnerability. Deception, artifice and keeping up appearances took up too much energy — I didn</span>’<span lang="EN-US">t have the stamina for my own pretence and little patience for it in others.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Honesty is simply a declaration of one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s own vulnerability — it is its keen, bright edge — and my own vulnerability and the vulnerability of others became, in the end, a kind of shared armour. I learned that, ultimately, our own truth and sense of self is all any of us have. We are enough, if we could only allow ourselves to be.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">This is the great value of </span><em><span lang="DE">The Red Hand Files</span></em><span lang="EN-US">. The questions that come in, so often naked and damaged and honest, offer me a form of salvation. I am the only one who accesses these questions, as I enter a sequestered world of mutual need. I read the questions each day, maybe fifty or so, sometimes more. It is like reading weird, brutal subterranean poetry, and like poetry they need to be read closely and with care. This exercise has become an essential part of my daily work. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">The ones I feel I can answer I put into a file. Then when the time comes to write something I choose a question that feels in need of a response. The particular question always leaps out at me, as if waiting its turn to be answered. I feel at home among these questions, exalted and protected by them. It is an absolute honour to be a part of this undertaking, whatever it is and wherever it may lead. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="NL">Love, Nick</span></p>

<p>Dear Natasha, Frank and Anja.</p>
<p>I wrote the line &#8211;</p>
<p>I slide my little songs out from under you</p>
<p>on the evening of the 5th of July 2014.</p>
<p>I know this because I refer to it in the Portland section of The Sick Bag Song, the epic poem I composed chronicling The Bad Seeds 2014 North American tour. I wrote &#8211;</p>
<p>‘Tonight I wrote down this line in the alley<br />
Behind the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall<br />
In Portland, Oregon<br />
Where I smoked and sat,<br />
I slide my little songs out from under you<br />
And I was very happy with that.’</p>
<p>What I meant by ‘very happy with that’ was that I felt a blissful pulse of prophecy calling from the future, that this line, written in an alley, in Portland, had an ulterior destiny that would in time reveal itself.</p>
<p>It appeared again in the Los Angeles section of The Sick Bag Song &#8211;</p>
<p>‘I cast a giant shadow against the sky.<br />
Like a miniature deity I gaze into the brown water.<br />
I slide my little songs out from under you.<br />
I am a small god crawling around a giant world,<br />
Becoming an engorged god crawling around a small world.’</p>
<p>But happy as I was with the line, and indeed the whole of The Sick Bag Song, I felt that I needed to position it within an actual song, so I spent the next six years trying to do just that. This became increasingly difficult, as every song I tried to put it in rejected it. It was just too good, I guess, and the other lines knew it. I remember one mercifully aborted song lyric went something like &#8211;</p>
<p>‘Praise be your za-zen legs and kundalini stew<br />
I slide my little songs out from under you’</p>
<p>Looking through my notebook I see it even tried its luck in an early version of ‘Rings of Saturn’ &#8211;</p>
<p>‘As she jumps up with her leaping brain<br />
I slide my little songs out from under her<br />
Stepping over piles of sleeping children’</p>
<p>But ‘Rings of Saturn’ would have none of it and the line was (thankfully) shunned and, once again, sent into exile.</p>
<p>Then it turned up on a potential B-side from the Skeleton Tree sessions called ‘Life Per Se’, which you saw me trying to teach the band on the 40 minute jam in One More Time With Feeling &#8211;</p>
<p>‘What then to do? What then to do?<br />
I slide my little songs out from under you’</p>
<p>But this song, beautiful though it was, didn’t end up on an actual record, so the line still had no place to lay its head.</p>
<p>The line seemed, as you pointed out, Natasha, to sum up everything &#8211; a life’s work, a credo, an ideology. I felt the line struck at the heart of the matter &#8211; that my songs were small studies in a larger project &#8211; the glorification of the ones I love.</p>
<p>In the end it found its way into ‘Night Raid’ from Ghosteen &#8211;</p>
<p>‘Sitting on the edge of the bed clicking your shoes<br />
I slid my little songs out from under you’</p>
<p>A near perfect place for it really, as ‘Night Raid’ is concerned mostly with the act of impregnation, of conception, of genesis, and the line &#8211;</p>
<p>‘I slid my little songs out from under you’</p>
<p>felt like the feminine counterweight to the overwrought masculinity of &#8211;</p>
<p>‘The spurting font of creativity, yeah I know’</p>
<p>This lovely line allowed the yang seed to fertilise the yin egg, up in Room 33, and birth what, in my opinion, may be the most beautiful and joyful song on the album.</p>
<p>But even so, I am still not completely sure the line has found its final resting place. It feels that it was created for a grander purpose, to be chiselled in granite, in a Luminari font, maybe; so, if it comes down to it, Frank, this is what I want on my gravestone &#8211;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: luminari,georgia,times new roman,serif;"><strong>I SLIDE MY LITTLE SONGS OUT FROM UNDER YOU</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p>unless, of course, I think of a better line in the meantime.</p>
<p>Which brings me to Bad Seed TeeVee &#8211; thanks to all of you who have written in about it. Bad Seed TeeVee is in its infant stages, and now the project is up and running, mountains of new footage is flooding in from everywhere. We are besieged! In time, perhaps we will invite fans to send in interesting stuff they have shot on their phones while they were supposed to have been watching the concert. We want Bad Seed TeeVee to become a vast, ever-mutating monster &#8211; full of the bold, the beautiful, the berserk and the completely absurd. Thank you all so much for tuning in &#8211; at last we all have a place to go!</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

<p>Susie and I have learned much about the nature of grief over recent years. We have come to see that grief is not something you pass through, as there is no other side. For us, grief became a way of life, an approach to living, where we learned to yield to the uncertainty of the world, whilst maintaining a stance of defiance to its indifference. We surrendered to something over which we had no control, but which we refused to take lying down. Grief became both an act of submission and of resistance — a place of acute vulnerability where, over time, we developed a heightened sense of the brittleness of existence. Eventually, this awareness of life’s fragility led us back to the world, transformed.</p>
<p>We discovered that grief was much more than just despair. We found grief contained many things — happiness, empathy, commonality, sorrow, fury, joy, forgiveness, combativeness, gratitude, awe, and even a certain peace. For us, grief became an attitude, a belief system, a doctrine — a conscious inhabiting of our vulnerable selves, protected and enriched by the absence of the one we loved and that we lost.</p>
<p>In the end, grief is an entirety. It is doing the dishes, watching Netflix, reading a book, Zooming friends, sitting alone or, indeed, shifting furniture around. Grief is all things reimagined through the ever emerging wounds of the world. It revealed to us that we had no control over events, and as we confronted our powerlessness, we came to see this powerlessness as a kind of spiritual freedom.</p>
<p>Susie’s grief has become part of her chemistry, it moves through her bloodstream like a force, and though she often inhabits the liminal space at the edge of dreams, she remains strong in her powerlessness and obstinately awed by the workings of the world.</p>
<p>Susie says to tell you she is very sorry to hear of your losses, very sorry, and looking at her now, I can only say to you both, that in time, <em>there is a way,</em> not out of grief, but deep within it.</p>
<p>With love to you both, Nick</p>

					<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Else,</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">A lovely question, and one that brings us back to </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Palaces of Montezuma.</span>’ <span lang="EN-US">If I recall correctly, Warren wrote the chords and backing vocal line to this song. I just listened to Rising Signs</span>&#8216; ‘Grey Man’ <span lang="EN-US">and it does sound pretty fucking similar. So, I phoned Warren, who is in lockdown in his studio in Paris, and asked him outright —</span></p>
<p class="Body">“<span lang="EN-US">Did you steal </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Palaces of Montezuma</span>’ <span lang="EN-US">from Rising Signs?</span>”</p>
<p class="Body">“Fuck, no!” <span lang="EN-US">he says, </span>“<span lang="EN-US">I stole it from The Laughing Clowns.</span>”</p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">The great beauty of contemporary music, and what gives it its edge and vitality, is its devil-may-care attitude toward appropriation — everybody is grabbing stuff from everybody else, <em>all the time</em>. It</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s a feeding frenzy of borrowed ideas that goes toward the advancement of rock music — the great artistic experiment of our era.  </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Plagiarism is an ugly word for what, in rock and roll, is a natural and necessary — even admirable — tendency, and that is to steal.</span> <span lang="EN-US">Theft is the engine of progress, and should be encouraged, even celebrated, provided the stolen idea has been advanced in some way. To advance an idea is to steal something from someone and make it so cool and covetable that someone then steals it from you. In this way, modern music progresses, collecting ideas, and mutating and transforming as it goes.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">But a word of caution, if you steal an idea and demean or diminish it, you are committing a dire crime for which you will pay a terrible price — whatever talents you may have will, in time, abandon you. If you steal, you must honour the action, further the idea, or be damned.  </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">So, </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Deanna</span>’<span lang="EN-US"> is based on </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Oh Happy Day</span>’<span lang="EN-US">, and the solo in the middle of </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Red Right Hand</span>’ <span lang="EN-US">may well have been stolen from </span>‘Bedazzled’<span lang="EN-US">, and </span>‘<span lang="PT">Tupelo</span>’ <span lang="EN-US">leans heavily on John Lee Hooker</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s song by the same name, and the theme from </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">The Road</span>’ <span lang="EN-US">sounds like the arpeggio work of Arvo P</span>ä<span lang="EN-US">rt, and the guitar riff in </span>‘Nobody’s Baby Now’ <span lang="EN-US">probably came straight out of a Van Morrison tune and, well, &#8216;Palaces of Montezuma&#8217;, it turns out, is based on a song by The Laughing Clowns, and so it goes — ideas, beautiful ideas, in full flow. Even though the influences may seem obvious, each of these songs, I think, has its own ingenuity, its own value and its own meaning. We musicians all stand on the shoulders of each other, our pirate pockets rattling with booty, our heads exploding with repurposed ideas. </span></p>
<p class="Body">“<span lang="EN-US">What else have you stolen?</span>” <span lang="EN-US">I ask Warren.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><em>“</em><em><span lang="EN-US">Everything,</span></em><em>”</em><span lang="EN-US"> he says, </span>“<span lang="EN-US">Absolutely, <em>everything.</em></span>”</p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="NL">Love, Nick </span></p>

					<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Sue, </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">I love </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Palaces of Montezuma</span>’<span lang="EN-US">. I really do. Amid all the obvious excesses of Grinderman, this song stands out as a simple and heartfelt declaration of human love, with a surreal and wonderfully fucked up lyric. It has a sort of versatile inner spirit that seems to work in any form.  I played it a number of times, solo at the piano, on my In Conversations tour — I was able to slow it down a bit and lean into the lyric and that seemed to work great too. I got to know the song pretty well. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">But even so, I</span>’<span lang="EN-US">m not really sure what inspired the lyric. It</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s not the sort of question I feel I have the authority to answer. These songs, you know, just present themselves. It seems to me to be essentially a cascade of increasingly bizarre and impossible acts of largesse, performed in the name of love. It seems to say, </span>“<span lang="EN-US">I love you and I will give you the world — all I require is the smallest word.</span>” <span lang="EN-US">What that word actually is remains a mystery — it may be<em> love </em></span>or <em><span lang="EN-US">sex </span></em>or <em>God</em><span lang="EN-US"> or </span><em>yes</em><span lang="EN-US"> or <em>thou</em> or </span><em>all </em><span lang="EN-US">— or not a word at all — a sigh — a grace. Whatever the word may be, it is essentially the whole world </span>“<em><span lang="EN-US">contained in a grain of sand — that can barely walk, can</span></em><em>’</em><em><span lang="EN-US">t even stand</span></em><em>”.</em><span lang="EN-US"> I suspect this idea may have migrated across time, and eventually found its way into the song </span>‘Ghosteen’, “<em><span lang="EN-US">There is nothing wrong with loving things that cannot even stand</span></em>.” <span lang="EN-US">I don</span>’<span lang="EN-US">t know. Just a thought. These ideas are wayfaring enigmas, for sure.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">I just put </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Palaces of Montezuma</span>’ <span lang="EN-US">on the record player and had a listen </span>and<span lang="EN-US">, hearing it again after so long, something occurred to me. I can</span>’<span lang="EN-US">t help but think that the song was helped along its way by the sweetly loony Lou Reed song, </span>‘Andy’<span lang="EN-US">s Chest</span>’, <span lang="EN-US">from his album, </span><em>Transformer</em><span lang="EN-US">. Perhaps that was the initial point of inspiration. I</span>’<span lang="EN-US">m not sure. I hope so. I love Lou Reed. I really do.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="NL">Love, Nick</span></p>

<p><span class="mc-toc-title">Dear Patrick,</span></p>
<p>The act of prayer is by no means exclusive to religious practise because prayer is not dependent on the existence of a subject. You need not pray <em>to </em>anyone. It is just as valuable to pray into your disbelief, as it is to pray into your belief, for prayer is not an encounter with an external agent, rather it is an encounter with oneself. There is as much chance of our prayers being answered by a God that exists as a God that doesn’t. I do not mean this facetiously, for prayers are very often answered.</p>
<p>A prayer provides us with a moment in time where we can contemplate the things that are important to us, and this watchful application of our attention can manifest these essential needs. The act of prayer asks of us something and by doing so delivers much in return — it asks us to present ourselves to the unknown as we are, devoid of pretence and affectation, and to contemplate exactly what it is we love or cherish. Through this conversation with our inner self we confront the nature of our own existence.</p>
<p>The coronavirus has brought us to our knees, yet it has also presented us with the opportunity to be prayerful, whether we believe in God or not. By forcing us into isolation, it has dismantled our constructed selves, by challenging our presumed needs, our desires, and our ambitions and rendered us raw, essential and reflective. Our sudden dislocation has thrown us into a mystery that exists at the edge of tears and revelation, for none of us knows what tomorrow will bring.</p>
<p>In our hubris we thought we knew, but as we bow our heads within the virus’ awesome power, all we are sure of now is our defencelessness. In the end this vulnerability may be, for our planet and ourselves, our saving grace, as we step chastened into tomorrow. Released from our certitude, we present our purest offering to the world — our prayers.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Dear Douglas, David, Emilia and Annie,</p>
<p>Many other people have also written in about Bob Dylan’s new song, ‘Murder Most Foul’ — and the interest is justifiable. It is a perplexing but beautiful song and, like many people, I have been extremely moved by it.</p>
<p>At the heart of this seventeen-minute epic is a terrible event, the assassination of JFK — a dark vortex that threatens to pull everything into it, just as it did in the USA back in 1963. Whirling around the incident Dylan weaves a litany of loved things — music mostly — that reach into the darkness, in deliverance. As the song unfolds he throws down lifeline after lifeline, insistent and mantra-like, and we are lifted, at least momentarily, free of the event. Dylan’s relentless cascade of song references points to our potential as human beings to create beautiful things, even in the face of our own capacity for malevolence. ‘Murder Most Foul’ reminds us that all is not lost, as the song itself becomes a lifeline thrown into our current predicament.</p>
<p>The instrumentation is formless and fluid and very beautiful. Lyrically it has all the perverse daring and playfulness of many of Dylan’s great songs, but beyond that there is something within his voice that feels extraordinarily comforting, especially at this moment. It is as though it has travelled a great distance, through stretches of time, full of an earned integrity and stature that soothes in the way of a lullaby, a chant, or a prayer.</p>
<p>As for whether this is the last time we will hear a new Bob Dylan song. I certainly hope not. But perhaps there is some wisdom in treating all songs, or for that matter, all experiences, with a certain care and reverence, as if encountering these things for the last time. I say this not just in the light of the novel coronavirus, rather that it is an eloquent way to lead one’s life and to appreciate the here and now, by savouring it as if it were for the last time. To have a drink with a friend as if it were the last time, to eat with your family as it were the last time, to read to your child as if it were the last time, or indeed, to sit in the kitchen listening to a new Bob Dylan song as if it were the last time. It permeates all that we do with greater meaning, placing us within the present, our uncertain future, temporarily arrested.</p>
<p>Annie, I was reading a poem today which very much resonates — it is by the beloved English poet Stevie Smith, who has given me much pleasure over the years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I Do Not Speak</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not ask for mercy for understanding for peace</p>
<p>And in these heavy days I do not ask for release</p>
<p>I do not ask that suffering shall cease</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not pray to God to let me die</p>
<p>To give an ear attentive to my cry</p>
<p>To pause in his marching and not hurry by</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not ask for anything I do not speak</p>
<p>I do not question and I do not seek</p>
<p>I used to in the day when I was weak</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I am strong and lapped in sorrow</p>
<p>As in a coat of magic mail and borrow</p>
<p>For Time today and care not for tomorrow</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much love, Nick</p>

<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Alice, Henry and Saskia,</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">My response to a crisis has always been to create. This impulse has saved me many times — when things got bad I</span>’d <span lang="EN-US">plan a </span><span lang="EN-US">tour, or write a book, or make a record — </span>I’<span lang="EN-US">d hide myself</span><span lang="EN-US"> in </span><span lang="EN-US">work, and try to stay</span><span lang="EN-US"> one step ahead of whatever it was that was pursuing me. So, when it became clear that The Bad Seeds would have to postpone the European tour and that I would have, at the very least, three months of sudden spare time, my mind jumped into overdrive with ideas of how to fill that </span><span lang="EN-US">space. On a video call with</span><span lang="EN-US"> my team we threw ideas around — stream a solo performance from my home, write an isolation album, write </span><span lang="EN-US">an online</span><span lang="EN-US"> corona diary, write an apocalyptic film </span><span lang="EN-US">script, create </span>a <span lang="EN-US">pandemic</span> <span lang="EN-US">playlist on Spotify</span><span lang="EN-US">, start an online reading </span><span lang="EN-US">club, answer </span><span lang="DE">Red</span><span lang="DE"> Hand Files </span><span lang="FR">questions </span><span lang="FR">live</span><span lang="EN-US"> online,</span><span lang="EN-US"> stream a songwriting tutorial, or a cooking programme, etc. — all with the aim to keep my creative momentum going, and to give my self-isolating fans something to do.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">That night, as I contemplated </span><span lang="EN-US">these ideas,</span><span lang="EN-US"> I began</span><span lang="EN-US"> to think about what I had done in the last three months — working with Warren and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, planning and mounting a massive and incredibly complex Nick Cave exhibition with </span><span lang="EN-US">the Royal Danish Library, putting together the Stranger Than Kindness book,</span><span lang="EN-US"> working on an updated </span><span lang="EN-US">edition of my &#8220;Collected Lyrics&#8221;</span>, <span lang="EN-US">developing the show for the Ghosteen world tour</span><span lang="EN-US"> (which, by the way, will be fucking mind-blowing if we ever get to do it!), </span><span lang="EN-US">working on a second</span><span lang="EN-US"> B Sides and Rarities record and, of course, reading and </span><span lang="EN-US">writing T</span><span lang="DE">he Red Hand</span><span lang="DE"> Files</span><span lang="DE">. </span><span lang="EN-US">As I sat there in bed and reflected</span>,<span lang="EN-US"> another thought presented itself, clear and wondrous and humane —</span><s> </s></p>
<p class="Body"><em><span lang="EN-US">Why is this the time to get creative?</span></em></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Together we have stepped into history and are now living inside an event unprecedented in our lifetime. </span><span lang="EN-US">Every day the</span><span lang="EN-US"> news provides us with dizzying information that a few weeks before would have been unthinkable. What deranged and divided us a month ago seems</span><span lang="EN-US">,</span> <span lang="DA">at best</span><span lang="EN-US">, an</span><span lang="EN-US"> embarrassment from an idle and privileged time. We have become eyewitnesses to a catastrophe that we are seeing unfold from the inside out. We are forced to isolate — to be vigilant, to be quiet, to watch and </span><span lang="EN-US">contemplate the possible </span><span lang="PT">implosion</span><span lang="EN-US"> of our civilisation</span> <span lang="EN-US">in real time</span><span lang="EN-US">. When we eventually step clear of this moment we will have discovered things about our leaders, our societal systems, our friends, our enemies and most of all, </span><span lang="EN-US">ourselves. We will know something of our resilience, our capacity for forgiveness, and our mutual vulnerability. Perhaps</span><span lang="EN-US">, it is a time to pay attention, to be mindful, to be observant.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">As an artist, it feels inapt to miss this extraordinary moment. </span><span lang="EN-US">Suddenly, the acts of writing a novel, or a screenplay or a series of songs seem like indulgences from a bygone </span><span lang="PT">era. </span><span lang="EN-US">For me, this is not a time to be buried in the business of creating. It is a time to tak</span><span lang="EN-US">e a backseat and use this opportunity to reflect on exactly what our </span><span lang="EN-US">function is — what we, as artists, are <em>for</em>.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Saskia, there are other</span> f<span lang="EN-US">orms of</span><span lang="EN-US"> engagement, open to us all. An email to a distant friend, a phone call to a parent or sibling, a kind word to a neighbour, a prayer for those working on the front lines.</span><span lang="EN-US"> These simple gestures can bind the world together — throwing threads of love here and there, ultimately connecting us all — so that when we do emerge from this moment we are unified by compassion, humility and a greater dignity. Perhaps, we will also see the world through different eyes, with an awakened reverence for the wondrous thing that it is. This could, indeed, be the truest creative work of all.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="NL">Love, Nick x</span></p>

					<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">The Red Hand Files has always been a space in which I could offer dubious existential </span><span lang="EN-US">notions, religious meditations, unsound advice, millennial senilities and general annoyances, while hopefully simultaneously extending a little human kindness and compassion. However, these sorts of ruminations came from a more privileged and fortunate time, when we had the oxygen to muse and to play. Things have changed, we are faced with a common enemy — impartial, unfeeling and of immeasurable magnitude — and it is no longer a time for abstractions. </span><span lang="EN-US">Now is the time to be cautious with our words, our opinions. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">A friend called </span><span lang="EN-US">our new world ‘a ghost ship’ — and maybe she is right. </span><span lang="EN-US">S</span><span lang="IT">he ha</span><span lang="EN-US">s recently lost someone dear to her and recognises acutely the premonitory feeling </span><span lang="EN-US">of a world about to be shattered — and </span><span lang="EN-US">that we will need to put ourselves back together again, not only personally, but societally. In time we will be given the opportunity to either contract around the old version of ourselves and our world — insular, self-interested and tribalistic — or understand the connectedness and commonality of all humans, everywhere. In isolation, we will be presented with our essence — of what we are personally and what we are as a society. We will be asked to decide what we want to preserve about our world and ourselves, and what we want to discard. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Eventually these questions will become of acute significance, but they are not for now. Now is a time to listen to those in more informed positions and to follow instructions, as difficult as that may be, as we step into the unprecedented unknowable. We should be careful about the noises we make — especially those with a public voice — and should not pretend to know what we do not. From within the clamour and tonnage of information and misinformation, of opinions and counter-opinions, of blame-games and grim prophecy and the most panic-inducing version of ‘Imagine’ ever recorded, emerges a simple message — wash your hands and (if you can) stay at home.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Love, Nick</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-US">It has been a very strange few weeks, much has happened to us all, and many difficult decisions have had to be made.

					<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Niccolò,</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">When Jesus was taken down from the cross, his body laid in a tomb and a stone rolled across the entrance, his twelve male disciples essentially fled. Mary Magdalene did not. In Matthew 27:61 it says —</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">“Mary Magdalene and the other Mary remained standing there in front of the tomb.”</span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">I think this haunted single sentence is probably my favourite moment from the Bible.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Misjudged by history, her fundamental importance in the Christian story undermined by the religious patriarchy, Mary Magdalene nevertheless remains the subversive nucleus around which the Gospel story revolves.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Mary Magdalene is the most moving symbol of true and resilient love, both earthly and spiritual. She ‘remains standing’ at the entrance of the tomb, the primary witness between two monumental events — the crucifixion and the resurrection — that have imprinted themselves upon history and fashioned not just Western thinking but the very essence of what we are, whether we like it or not. Mary Magdalene, forever standing at the mouth of the tomb in steadfast vigil, gazing out of history, is embedded in our subconscious. She is the true icon of feminine grief — complex, elemental, patient, empathetic and full of sorrowing wonder, and a manifestation of both physical and transcendent love — the true human hero of the Christian story. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Love, Nick</span></p>

					<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Gavin, </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">These days, some of my songs are feeling a little nervous. They are like children that have been playing cheerfully in the schoolyard, only to be told that all along they have had some hideous physical deformity. Their little hearts sink and they piss their pants. They leave the playground burning with shame, as a scornful, self-righteous future turns around with its stone and takes aim. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">But what songwriter could have predicted thirty years ago that the future would lose its sense of humour, its sense of playfulness, its sense of context, nuance and irony, and fall into the hands of a perpetually pissed off coterie of pearl-clutchers? How were we to know? </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Perhaps we writers should have been more careful with our words &#8211; I can own this, and I may even agree &#8211; however, we should never blame the songs themselves. Songs are divinely constituted organisms. They have their own integrity. As flawed as they may be, the souls of the songs must be protected at all costs. They must be allowed to exist in all their aberrant horror, unmolested by these strident advocates of the innocuous, even if just as some indication that the world has moved toward a better, fairer and more sensitive place. If punishment must be administered, punish the creators, not the songs. We can handle it. I would rather be remembered for writing something that was discomforting or offensive, than to be forgotten for writing something bloodless and bland. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Love, Nick</span></p>

<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Joscha, Kevin, Somebody, Samantha and Liz,</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">‘Girl in Amber’ is a song wrapped around a mystery. It is a song that formed itself as if from a dream and it seems to possess a special, almost mystical, power.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Back in 2014, I was sitting at Warren’s kitchen table after a day of making music in his little studio at the back of his house in Paris. On the table was a paperweight with a spider trapped inside, and the title ‘Girl in Amber’ slipped into my mind. I remember feeling happy, because I rarely get given titles for songs — the title almost </span><em><span lang="EN-US">always </span></em><span lang="EN-US">comes after a long struggle with the words — and this one seemed alive with meaning. It made me think of people I knew who were in a state of stasis, forever locked in the past, but it was not about anyone in particular. Or so I thought. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">I recorded a version of the song that day, improvising the repetitive, mantra-like lyric, and then forgot about it.</span></p>
<p class="Body" style="text-align: center;"><span lang="EN-US">***</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">A year or so later, I was in another studio in Paris attempting to finish Skeleton Tree. Things had changed. Arthur, my son, had died a few months earlier and I was existing in a kind of fugue-state, numbly sitting in the studio listening to the songs, trying to make sense of the material we had been working on over the last year, and as I listened to the version of ‘Girl in Amber’, I was completely overwhelmed by what I heard.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">It was suddenly and tragically clear that ‘Girl in Amber’ had found its ‘</span><em><span lang="EN-US">who’</span></em><span lang="EN-US">. The ‘who’ was Susie, my wife — held impossibly, as she was at the time, within her grief, reliving each day a relentless spinning song that began with the ringing of the phone and ended with the collapse of her world. The eerie, death-obsessed second verse seemed to speak directly to me, and I added the half-line ‘Your little blue-eyed boy’, but left the rest of the verse as it was. There were a couple of lines in the song that made little sense, but I left them unchanged for they brought a fractured inarticulateness to the lyric, which added to its mysterious, emotional pull. I added the line ‘Don’t touch me’ in the mixing session some months later. It felt true.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">In 1998, I wrote in a lecture called </span><em><span lang="EN-US">The Secret Life of the Love Song</span></em><span lang="EN-US"> about the strange, second sight that certain songs seemed to have, and certainly there are a number of songs on </span><em><span lang="EN-US">Skeleton Tree</span></em><span lang="EN-US"> that appeared to speak into the future, but nothing as acutely and tragically as ‘Girl in Amber’. ‘Girl in Amber’ seemed to possess an uncanny clairvoyance, a secret intelligence — the song was already deep in mourning before the tragedy had occurred.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">When I sang ‘Girl in Amber’ on the </span><em><span lang="EN-US">Skeleton Tree </span></em><span lang="EN-US">tour, it felt very much as if I was singing into the terrible present — my wife still trapped in the amber of her grief. Last month I performed it on the </span><em><span lang="EN-US">In Conversation </span></em><span lang="EN-US">tour. Three years had gone by and it struck me as I sang it, alone at the piano, that I was speaking to the past, and that Susie had been released, at least in part, from the suffocating darkness that surrounded her. There was some air and some light between her and the world. Time had done its work.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Liz, I would like to think that ‘Girl in Amber’ went some way toward releasing both my wife and me from the paralysis of our grief, as you suggest it helped you. I would also add that it has been my experience that although we are all, in some way or another, imprisoned by the events of our seemingly intractable pasts, in time, patient time, we heal. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Love, Nick</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">This is the 20,000<sup>th</sup> question to The Red Hand Files. It is also the funniest. I am sending it out to the world as an act of mercy and although I don’t think about the circumstances of my death too much, I hope I’ll go with as much joy and humour in my heart as I had upon reading your question. You are a beautiful human being and thank you for the many letters you have sent.</p>

<p>Dear Sadegh,</p>
<p>Some years ago my dear friend, Arash from Tehran sent me a link to the movie, <em>No One Knows About Persian Cats.</em> This has to be one of the great rock ‘n’ roll movies of all time. Courageous, funny, dangerous, heart-breaking yet ultimately uplifting, it shows, as clear as any movie I can think of, the pure subversive force of rock ‘n’ roll, its incredible resilience, its unifying power and its transcendent nature. The extraordinary lengths the musicians go to in order to play their music, despite the grotesque and repressive nature of the regime, is truly inspiring.</p>
<p>I receive a lot of letters from Iran on <em>The Red Hand Files</em> and it is a genuine sadness for us that we are unable to play in your country. I hope one day that will change. There appears to be an ever-growing hunger in Iran to resist these oppressive measures and stand up for basic freedoms, artistic or otherwise. I wish you all the best in that struggle.</p>
<p>Of course, there are paternalistic and authoritarian forces that exist everywhere, to a greater or lesser degree; these come in a variety of different guises, always in the name of some greater virtue, yet always with the same intent — to silence musicians and free expression. We must, of course, resist.</p>
<p>The good news, however, is that it looks like The Bad Seeds will be playing in Istanbul next year, and if it is anything like the show we did there in 2018, it&#8217;s going to be a blast. It was a special time for us. Email me your address, Sadegh, and we can arrange tickets for the show. The Bad Seeds and I will be happy to see you, although it is sad you have to come so far.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Evie, in no way are you doomed! Who</span><span lang="EN-US"> wants to hang out with someone who </span><em><span lang="EN-US">agrees with you </span></em><span lang="EN-US">all the time? A certain friction is essential, and disagreement and mutual forgiveness can become the measure of an interesting and durable relationship.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">I am </span><span lang="EN-US">reminded of my long</span><span lang="EN-US"> friendship with Bobby Gillespie. Now, there is much we don’t agree on politically, however it has done nothing to affect our relationship, other than to energise it, I think. And not everything is politics</span><span lang="EN-US">. At the end of the day, there</span><span lang="EN-US"> is always </span><em><span lang="EN-US">The Sensational Alex Harvey Band!</span></em></p>

<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">N: I’ve been stranded in Porto airport for hours. Nothing is happening. I want to shoot myself.</span></p>

<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">N: Fuck! I’ve never seen that! My first band was basically an Alex Harvey cover band. We did Framed, Isobel Goudie, Faith Healer, Gang Bang, Next, Midnight Moses, everything. I wore jeans and a tight cropped t-shirt and our guitarist wore clown make-up like Zal.</span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">B: I love that u guys loved Alex Harvey. He did an interview before punk where he said that rock music had become stale and needed high-energy (my words) bands to rise up and blow away the old guard.</span></span></p>

<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">N: Our first gig was a Battle of the Bands thing in a country town and we played ‘Framed’ and came second. It’s been downhill ever since. </span></span></p>

<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">B: It’s fantastic. I borrowed that album as a teen and that track blew my mind. “The first taste of</span></span> <span class="None"><span lang="EN-US">Gonorrhea”</span></span><span class="None"><span lang="IT">. Amazing.</span></span></p>

<h3>MILA, AMSTERDAM, HOLLAND</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Lataban and Mila,</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">It seems to me that many of the great artists, especially in music, appear to possess a wildly conflicted sense of themselves, yet persistently pursue their own uniqueness, even when it runs at odds with the orthodoxies of the day. They tend to be outliers, abyss-gazers and misfits, whose sense of isolation is further amplified by their notoriety, and who use their art as a way of connecting to people and legitimising their own strangeness. They understand, on some level, that it is the nature of their vocation to steal across the borders of convention, collect up ideas and bring them back to the world. This requires a certain reckless spirit and it may be that some spend too long on </span><span lang="EN-US">the other side</span> <span lang="EN-US">and that it becomes difficult for them to return. However, whether any of this is actual mental illness, I don</span>’<span lang="EN-US">t know. This term feels too elastic, too nebulous to comment. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Whether being hurt is a necessary requirement to creativity is only true in so much as to </span><em><span lang="DA">live</span></em><span lang="EN-US"> is partly to suffer. You cannot create without suffering, because you cannot live without suffering. One of the jobs of a songwriter, as I see it, is to develop strategies to help people transcend their sorrows. This is the unique duality of a great song &#8211; that it can reflect back at the listener the extent of their own hurt, yet lift them beyond it at the same time. How often have we wept ourselves to transcendence through music?</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Part of the process for the songwriter is to stay alert to the nature of their own wounds without indulging them, to gravitate towards happiness when possible, to venture beyond convention and acceptability without losing oneself, to understand that our most treasured beliefs exist on the far side of what we think we know, and to go there cautiously, yet fearlessly and, perhaps most importantly of all, to remember to return.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="NL">Love, Nick </span></p>

I&#039;m currently (and have been for the past 9 years) emulating your rock n&#039; roll persona in a Nick Cave tribute band. I dress up like you (a cheap version, no stylist, can&#039;t find a shirt like yours) and in a shamanistic way recreate your live performances, sometimes succeeding to trick the audience into a feeling of being nearer to you. I&#039;m sorry if you feel I am a vampire sucking on you, but I&#039;m not ready to &quot;do my own thing&quot;. In the name of the Cave Dogs (the tribute band from Serbia, not the power pop band from Boston) I have to ask you if you know of us, and what do you think of us? : The Red Hand Files</title>

<p>Dear Nik,</p>
<p>I was not familiar with the Cave Dogs, I am afraid, but having watched you on YouTube, I have this to say — you sound fucking <em>terrifyingly</em> like me. You have even perfected my peculiar relationship with the Gods of Intonation. In fact, when I was playing it Susie, my wife, walked in the room with her arms full of dresses and fabric swatches and said, “Wo! Babe, you’re sounding good.” And I’m like, “Thanks. It’s not me. It’s a Serbian imposter.” And she says, “Oh, sorry,” and walks out again. So, you are obviously doing something right. But you are also correct to suggest you don’t have the right shirt. If you send me your email address, I’ll send you one of my old ones and a suit — I have many — or a hit squad. I’m not sure which.</p>
<p>Love, the other Nick</p>

<h1 class="post-title">Do you like Kanye?</h1>
<h3>NAJA, LOS ANGELES, USA</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Math and Naja,</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">We love and respect our fans, both past and present, but, of course, they are free to come and go as they please. What The Bad Seeds are trying to do is to nurture our listeners, to challenge and confront them, to make records that create some kind of dissonance, and perhaps even disturb them, but hopefully ultimately move them. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Losing fans is the collateral damage that comes from engaging in music from an artistic perspective, rather than a commercial one. Making music specifically to please fans can be patronising and exploitative. Challenging music, by its very nature, alienates some fans whilst inspiring others, but without that dissonance, there is no conversation, there is no risk, there are no tears and there are no smiles, and <em>nobody</em> is moved and <em>nobody</em> is affected!</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">For some of us, moments of genuine emotional resonance are rare; we are besieged by insincere forces and have become cynical and suspicious of the world. Many letters to <em>The Red Hand Files</em> signal a despair and anger toward the way the world operates, but they also display a deep love of beauty and a need for meaning. We want to make records that do not add to the hollow clamour that surrounds us but instead challenge people and guide them toward meaning. As I’ve said before, how we achieve this is, to an extent, out of our hands. As a band, we can only move toward what stirs us and this generally exists within the unfamiliar and unconventional. In this place, we are challenged, even unnerved, but ultimately rewarded and we hope that our fans are too. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">With each new record, almost inevitably some fans will move on. I can only say that I am truly grateful to have been a part of their journey, and </span><span lang="EN-US">that </span><span lang="EN-US">they have been part of ours. In the end, to challenge our fans is to love them, even if it means losing them. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA" style="text-align: center;"><span lang="EN-US">***  </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Making art is a form of madness &#8211; we slip deep within our own singular vision and become lost to it. There is no musician on Earth that is as committed to their own derangement as Kanye, and in this respect, at this point in time, he is our greatest artist.  </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="NL">Love, Nick</span></p>

<h3>SUSAN, AUSTIN, USA</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Jon and Susan,</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">At around 8</span>’ 30’’ <span lang="EN-US">into the song </span>‘<span lang="DA">Hollywood</span>’ <span lang="EN-US">the narrator stands on the beach, looking out to sea. Malibu is on fire and the animals have been driven down from the hills to the shore. A sea serpent rises out of the ocean. A small boy drops his bucket and spade and climbs into the sun. Jon, this series of images came to me while in the back of a car driving around your city of Oslo on the last Bad Seeds’</span><span lang="FR"> tour</span><span lang="EN-US">,</span> <span lang="EN-US">and was the first step toward the writing of </span><em>Ghosteen</em><span lang="EN-US">. Within this sudden vision the whole of the album presented itself. It is rare in songwriting to be given such a rich and sustaining gift.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Some months later I wrote what would become the second verse of </span>‘<span lang="DA">Hollywood</span>’ &#8211; <span lang="EN-US">the image of my wife, as a white cougar with </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">a terrible engine of wrath for a heart</span>’<span lang="EN-US">, roaming the Hollywood Hills. This single image of rage-filled, carnivorous grief sat in my notebook waiting for a home.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">The Buddhist story of Kisa and the Mustard Seed, that would eventually be the final part of </span>‘<span lang="DA">Hollywood</span>’<span lang="EN-US">, had been of great significance and comfort to me for years and at some point I jotted it down in verse form, completely independent of anything else, and with no intention of it being a song.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Early in 2018, at the initial </span>‘<span lang="IT">improv</span>’ <span lang="EN-US">recording sessions in Brighton, Warren threw down the driving </span>‘<span lang="DA">Hollywood</span>’ <span lang="EN-US">loop and at the same time played the beautiful circular synth chords. Meanwhile, I sat jamming at the piano and dumping lyrics onto it. I had all these disparate images rolling around in my head, unmoored and desperate for a home &#8211; Malibu on fire, the cougar roaming the hills, the terrified animals on the shore, the breaching leviathan, the kid and the sun, Kisa and her baby &#8211; and the restless propulsion of the loop allowed me to just spill them out. I didn</span>’<span lang="EN-US">t at the time know what they meant, or how they connected to each other. We played non-stop for hours, lost to it. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Listening back, in the studio a week or so later, most of the extended jam was unusable, but there was a fifteen minute section, towards the end, that was mysterious and compelling and so we edited it out and kept it. It included within it the cougar scene, the beach and the fire, and the Kisa story. The remainder of the lyrics were there as well, extemporized yet complete. We added some strings, backing vocals, Tommy</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s beautiful drumming, tidied up the vocal a bit and it became </span>‘<span lang="DA">Hollywood.</span>’ <span lang="EN-US">It was effortless and enigmatic and it spoke to us from another place, crying from the future whilst calling</span> <span lang="EN-US">from the past.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">In the song </span>‘Ghosteen’<span lang="EN-US">, a man is saying goodbye to a sleeping woman &#8211; he is leaving, heading somewhere, we don</span>’<span lang="EN-US">t know where. </span>‘<span lang="DA">Hollywood</span>’ <span lang="EN-US">is a continuation of this song. It is the leaving, the driving away, heading out of LA, along the Pacific Coast to Malibu. Malibu is on fire. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">We recorded most of the record at Woodshed Studios, in Malibu, later in 2018,</span> <span lang="EN-US">in a single recording room surrounded by an Eden-like garden. The control desk was inside the room, so visiting musicians, friends and dogs all sat in the same room in which we recorded. Warren and I stayed at the house attached to the studio, perched on the valley hill, and it was an extraordinarily intense and magical time for both of us. A few weeks after we left the studio, the Malibu fires swept through the area. The studio itself remained mysteriously unharmed, but the house, the beautiful garden, and the surrounding homes</span> <span lang="EN-US">were incinerated. It was devastating for us all. The studio is now back up and running and will always hold a very special place in our hearts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Susan, the idea that songs are prophetic is the kind of magical thinking which</span> <span lang="EN-US">I would normally reject, but there has been too much coincidence, too often, not to feel that some songs perhaps hold a certain unsettling knowledge, beyond the understanding of their creators. I suspect we all have intimations or intuitions, that are holding conversations with the future, but that we tend to disregard, perhaps at our peril. As songwriters we are given scraps of information &#8211; </span><span lang="FR">images, visions, projections, divination &#8211; </span><span lang="EN-US">that become the building blocks for songs; these uncanny hunches are the stuff we work with, the material with which we create, so the songs end up feeling elastic, stretching themselves forward in time and back into the past. They can feel like preternatural witnesses to things yet to come, signallers calling urgently from an emergency &#8211; the future &#8211; while haunted by what has gone before. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">And now, as we watch Australia burn, no such indicators are necessary. As Carl from Belgium says, in a lette</span><span lang="EN-US">r to ‘</span><span lang="EN-US">The Red Hand Files’ </span><span lang="EN-US">“</span><span lang="EN-US">the Australian fires are a global torch illuminating the human condition. Nature, on its knees, is a dangerous beast”.  The future, it seems, is here. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Sending love, Nick </span></p>

<h1 class="post-title">How do you celebrate Christmas?</h1>
<h3>JOSHUA, BERLIN, GERMANY</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 class="post-title">I read today that when a photon is born in the Sun, it take it 1,000,000 years to come to the Sun&#8217;s surface (it&#8217;s colliding with other particles and constantly changes its direction). And then a further few minutes to reach the Earth. Something that is so ordinary as the sunlight appears to have its own, very ancient history. &#8220;We are photons released from a dying star&#8221;. It&#8217;s so great we&#8217;ve got the chance to take part in this cosmic spectacle and that we can consciously contemplate it, don&#8217;t you think?</h1>
<h3>M, WARSAW, POLAND</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Tim, Joshua and M,</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Christmas to me is the remnant of an evaporating culture to which I once belonged.</span> <span lang="EN-US">I am not a Christian, yet I am attached to its culture, personally, nostalgically and sentimentally. It is not the only culture available, there are others, equally valid or invalid, both religious and secular. But, for me, as someone who grew up in an Anglican home, sang in the cathedral choir, and has an enduring fascination with the Christian scriptures, the Christian story, in all its quaintness and implausibility, holds great meaning. Christ continues to move through my imagination, a vaporous ghost beckoning from the shadows, and his story affects me deeply. Jesus is an absurdity that rises eerily from my yearning for spiritual comfort, within a cosmos I cannot begin to understand. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">And M, I can</span>’<span lang="EN-US">t agree with you more. The fascination of the universe is a wonder so monumental that we are left dizzy with awe as we attempt to contemplate it. Infinity lives on the far side of language, touching only the fringes of our understanding, and I admire those who devote their lives to the investigation of this impossibility.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">As stars are born and die, the phenomena of suffering and love are projected onto Earth to play out in the seeming inconsequentiality of our human lives. We are the broken metaphors of a cosmos that is beyond our comprehension.  </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Christ is a symbol of our imperfect and limited attempt at understanding</span> <span lang="EN-US">eternity, and addresses the vulnerability of humanity itself. Perhaps we</span> <span lang="EN-US">should not look </span>at <span lang="EN-US">the Christian story as a symbol of our naivety or</span> <span lang="EN-US">ignorance, but instead cherish it as our attempt to</span> <span lang="EN-US">comprehend the incomprehensible.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">So, Tim and Joshua, as Christianity retreats back into the churches and cathedrals, as all conspicuous notions of Christ fade from our culture, and Christmas becomes the sole province of a roly-poly man in a Coca-Cola red suit (whose days may also be numbered) I will visit a church this Christmas; I will kneel before the fading vestiges of an outmoded idea called spiritual transcendence and our beautiful and moving attempt to humanise the ecstatic cosmic drama, and I will pray.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="NL">Love, Nick</span></p>

<h1 class="post-title">Have you ever reached the same highs when sober as when you were on some sort of lovely substance?</h1>
<h3>CRAIG, LEEDS, UK</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Serge and Craig,</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">My song ‘Deanna’ is a collision of dissonant imagery, beautiful transgressions, reckless theatrics, secret admissions, impossible lusts, erroneous politics and fuck you</span> <span lang="EN-US">swaggering, that ultimately resolves itself into a pure expression of the monstrous rapture of youth.</span> <span lang="EN-US">It represents a time of joyful and wilful abandon, into drugs, into music, into danger, into love, into life itself. Like love, the song cannot be broken down into its respective parts without doing a grave injustice to its mystery and its glory. ‘</span><span lang="IT">Deanna</span><span lang="EN-US">’ is a capsule of incautious adoration that alerts us to the futility of judging the actions of our past through the lens of what we have become, no matter how much wiser, more aware and insightful we think we are. As an old guy, I probably have no right to sing it, yet I do</span> <span lang="EN-US">as ‘Deanna’ holds a special place in my heart and it propels me back to a fearless and less fractured time. It remains “a song that yearns to be sung.”</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">No carpet on the floor</span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">And the winding cloth holds many moths</span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">Around your Ku Klux furniture</span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">I come a death’s head in your frock</span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">As for your question, Serge, </span><span lang="IT">Deanna</span><span lang="EN-US">’s mother was American and each Christmas she would leave Melbourne and head back to the U.S. for the holidays, leaving her maverick daughter in charge of the house that sat high up on the south bank of the Yarra River. Perhaps anticipating our behaviour, her mother covered the furniture in the living room with protective white sheets—the Ku Klux furniture, we called it. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">What happened to Deanna? I’m not really sure. She went to live in the States, and we lost touch. But for me she lives inside the song, imprisoned there, just as <em>I</em> am in all my songs, and that is the melancholy beauty of them; songs become a form of entrapment—you write one and then throw away the key. </span></p>
<p class="BodyAA"><span lang="EN-US">Craig, I’m not sure if I have quite reached the same highs as those times while sober, but then again I also haven’t reached the kind of lows that eventually came with taking those ‘lovely substances’— bashed up in police stations, dehumanised in rehabs, near-death experiences, suicidal thoughts, routine overdoses, reduced motivation, broken bones, being ripped off, liking Charles Bukowski, social and physical anhedonia, herd mentality, dead friends, fucked up relationships, abscesses, car accidents, psychosis, reading The Hobbit,</span> <span lang="EN-US">malnutrition, creative impotence, </span><span lang="IT">epic </span><span lang="EN-US">time-wasting, singing flat (still working on that), talking shit (still working on that too), life-threatening diseases, and not ringing my mother on her birthday.</span></p>
<p class="BodyAA"><span lang="NL">Love, Nick </span></p>

<p>Dear Chris, Luke, Alex and Bradley,</p>
<p>There is nothing on this earth that is so serious that it cannot be elevated by humour. Humour is not lack of gravity and it is not frivolity. Rather, it is the merciful oxygen that can envelop seriousness and prevent it from becoming a grim contagion that infects ourselves and those around us. True humour is the antidote to dogmatism and fanaticism, and we must be cautious of the humourless and those who cannot take a joke.</p>
<p>Humour is the way in which we manoeuvre ourselves through the things that are difficult to talk about, that require subtlety of thought, that are counter-intuitive, uncertain and mysterious. Humour is a way of exploring the uncomfortable without fully committing ourselves, testing and pushing at the boundaries of acceptability, always able to retreat back into the form itself.</p>
<p>In this respect, Luke, I am a humourist, and many of my songs are essentially comic songs. I have always used humour as a way of presenting ideas that may otherwise be considered unacceptable. Humour is a device that allows us to push against the constraints of decorum and say the uncomfortable things that challenge our presumptions; it allows us room to <em>breathe</em>.</p>
<p>It is for this reason, Chris, that I have such deep admiration for comedians, from Buster Keaton to Lenny Bruce to Dave Chappelle. Anarchic and troublesome, comedians are the canaries in the coal mine of ideas, often saying things that cannot safely be said elsewhere and taking significant personal risk to speak truth, not just to power, but to stupidity too, to outrage and self-righteousness. Between the joke and the laughter resides our common humanity and as our laughing bodies relax, our hearts and minds open and serious ideas can penetrate. Humour is the Trojan horse that crosses the moat and infiltrates the castle, bringing with it the unsayable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, humour allows us to laugh at ourselves and the absurdity of our human predicament. Humour tells us that we are, in the greater scheme of things, both completely meaningless and supremely meaningful, and though our efforts are of no real consequence, they are heroic and deeply moving.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>
<p>P.S. Bradley, The Bad Seeds are bound together by both our music and our collective sense of humour, however it is impossible to exaggerate just how funny Conway Savage was. Conway had a Depression-era, Dust Bowl wit, so dry and parched you couldn’t help but feel his perfectly timed, apocalyptic one-liners were the true cause of the world’s environmental chaos. We miss Conway very much.</p>

		<title>Nick Cave - The Red Hand Files - Issue #74 - I have a question about grief. You have written exquisitely on the subject, and I have found great comfort in your words, and have great empathy for you and your family&#039;s devastating loss of your precious son.My mom was murdered with an AR-15 by a white supremacist in our synagogue, killed because this 19-year-old felt Jews were &#039;destroying&#039; the white race. It has been almost 8 months, I stopped counting out of numbness, and I still don&#039;t have anger towards the shooter, but more so for people who my mother was close to, and in her death, claimed my mother as their own, and exploited the situation for their own gain. I am afraid to let go of the anger, because I feel it connects me to my mother, and to the tragedy where she died, my last experience with her. I am afraid to move forward in any way. Family members are grieving in a different way than I am and that makes things even more uncomfortable. I am afraid to connect or feel my mother&#039;s spirit in any way. Do you have any advice on these components of grief: the anger; the fear. With utmost gratitude towards your input, : The Red Hand Files</title>

					<p>Dear Hannah,</p>
<p>This is a very difficult question to answer, there are no adequate words and I worry that I will not do the enormity of the tragedy of your mother’s death justice, or your grief, for that matter. I apologise if I fall short. I cannot claim to understand the complexities of your situation, but although the circumstances are very different, I do understand about dealing with a death that is in the public eye and the deranging internal conflicts that it can bring.</p>
<p>The tragedy of my son’s death is inscribed into the collective consciousness of the town where we live and where he died. I have had to learn to share the reality of his passing with the town itself, because it affected us all. I doubt there was a mother in Brighton who did not feel a chill of horror and cling to her own children a little tighter upon hearing the news of Arthur’s senseless accident. But Arthur was our child, our own flesh and blood; Susie and I didn’t want to share him with anyone, and we were deeply possessive over his absence. It took us some time to understand that while he belonged to us, he belonged to the world too. In time we understood that, although we were the ultimate custodians of Arthur’s memory, he was, in fact, mourned by many, and many people felt outraged at the cruelty and randomness of the event, just as we did. Susie and I, individually and together, had to find a way to be with Arthur, but also to share him with a multitude.</p>
<p>In time we found a place away from the concerns of the world and our own conflicted feelings, that was silent and vast, where we could have the necessary and ongoing conversation with our son, to tell him that we loved him, and that we missed him, and that we were sorry. We found a place where we can be with him, in grief, beyond the glare and the noise of the world, a place of meaning.</p>
<p>Hannah, your tragedy was not an accident, nor a random act of fate, and this incident was an egregious affront to both your community and our collective humanity. Your mother was your mother, but she was also a Jew, and along with other members of her community simply doing the thing that observant Jews have always done on a Saturday morning. How difficult it must be for you to untangle this and find that silent space where you can speak with your mother, as her daughter, and be heard above the tumult of other people’s expectations, the various agendas of the media, your own rage and the enormity of the act itself. How can you find your own meaning in your mother’s passing?</p>
<p>It feels to me, that the meaning exists within the anger. Not only is your anger justified, it is compassionate and essential and, as you said, connects you to your mother, even as those around you take possession of her, eclipsing your feelings with their own needs. The righteous energy of your anger is the flaming sword you hold above your mother’s memory. It may be the very thing that protects her, shielding her from the suffocating demands of the world. Perhaps, at this time, your anger is a way of safekeeping the spirit of your mother, of caring for her, of seeking her, of calling her to you. It is a pure and holy anger.</p>
<p>But there is another place too, a quieter place that patiently awaits you, and maybe in time you will find a moment to temporarily lay down the sword and, speaking into the sacred silence, talk to your mother, in grief, in longing, and in her presence, and perhaps find some solace there. I very much hope so.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

		<title>Nick Cave - The Red Hand Files - Issue #73 - Many people have remarked that Ghosteen is a sad album, but I don&#039;t think it is at all. In fact I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever heard a more uplifting, jubilant record before. When I listened to it the first time alone, I was brought to tears. And when I listened to it again with my friend, both of us sitting in the car in complete silence, we both felt moved by its brightness and gentle optimism. Why do you think people are reacting so differently to it? I almost feel like I&#039;ve misinterpreted it. : The Red Hand Files</title>

<div>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Jonah, Amber and Kjell,</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">I am very happy to hear you describe Ghosteen as uplifting and jubilant, Jonah. This was certainly the Bad </span><span lang="EN-US">Seeds</span><span lang="EN-US">’ objective</span><span lang="EN-US"> when we made the record. We wanted each song to feel as if it were climbing toward an exultant and euphoric state, for the record to be a vessel that transported the listener far away from the world and its </span><span lang="EN-US">troubles, and</span><span lang="EN-US"> that it lived in the jubilant and hopeful beyond. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">If there is sadness in Ghosteen, perhaps it is the recognition that we are often blind to the splendour of the world and </span><span lang="EN-US">indifferent to its attendant</span><span lang="EN-US"> wonder. Perhaps the sadness is the recognition that the world is indeed beautiful, that it spins within the palm of our own hands and its beauty is available to </span><span lang="EN-US">all, if only we had eyes to see. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">And maybe</span><span lang="EN-US">, </span><span lang="EN-US">Amber, you are right and Ghosteen is haunted. Perhaps the songs became a kind of free-floating conversation with the spirit world</span><span lang="EN-US">,</span><span lang="EN-US"> buoyed up by the absence of the ones we love. Perhaps the ghostly forms of the departed are all around us, magnetised toward the act of creation. Perhaps they see that to be alive and upon the earth, at this time and against all the odds, is the most rare and coveted of things, and to be making art such a singular and fortuitous privilege, that they just wanted to come along for the ride. In the song Ghosteen, baby bear goes to the moon in a boat; Ghosteen <em>is</em> that boat, as it sails through the dark to the stars, a galleon ship collecting fireflies and spirit-children as it goes. At times Ghosteen may feel unmoored and homeless, but it is pointed firmly toward paradise, the crew is joyous, the world smiles, and the sun bursts over the edge of the earth.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA" style="text-align: center;"><span lang="EN-US">***</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Kjell, to answer your question, Thomas Wydler, our drummer, did some amazing work on this record, however, after a great deal of thought, we all felt that the drums anchored the songs to the ground and didn’t allow them to float. The</span><span lang="IT"> decision</span><span lang="EN-US"> was not made lightly or on a whim, rather it was a tough artistic decision determined by the needs of the songs themselves. Although there is little drumming on the first part of Ghosteen, Tommy’s absence is courageous and monumental and gives the record its amorphous sound. He is the very best there is.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">The </span><span lang="IT">decision </span><span lang="EN-US">as to what sort of record we make is largely out of our hands. We have no ‘</span><span lang="FR">intentions</span><span lang="EN-US">’ beyond meaning itself. The record must <em>mean</em> something, right? What more can we ask? The form that that</span> <span lang="EN-US">expression of meaning comes in is, to some degree, beside the point. We are slaves to manifest meaning and masters to nothing at all.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="NL">Love, Nick</span></p>

					<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Slim Lee, </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">During my more gloomy moments I sometimes wonder if anyone actually listens to my lyrics, and whether the enormous amount of work I put into them may in fact go unheeded. So it was with very real gratitude that I read this question, as you had clearly reflected long and hard on the matter. I am very moved, to be honest. On my knees, I thank you </span><span lang="EN-US">(but not in that way).</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">I didn’t even have to look at the address of this question to know that you were from Melbourne.</span> <span lang="EN-US">We Melburnians</span> <span lang="EN-US">are warped but meticulous thinkers and, I would tentatively suggest, a step ahead of everyone else. Our minds simply jump the leash and run, unchecked and slavering, where others fear to tread. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">It did occur to me one night, as I performed Stagger Lee in full priapic flight, that Stagger Lee does not shoot Billy Dilly with an actual gun at all, but that his being &#8220;f</span><span lang="EN-US">illed full of lead. Bang! Bang! Bang!” was simply a metaphor for the force of Stag’s ejaculation, and Blixa’s terrifying and inhuman screeching at the end orgasmic in nature. This made me wonder, chillingly at the time, what sleeping with Blixa must be like – something I am sadly unable to elaborate on. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Beyond that, my friend, I have nothing more to add, but if any more theories about my songs work their way into your beautiful mind, perhaps on one of those warm and eerie Melbourne nights, where the fruit bats fly from tree to tree, please do not hesitate to write in and tell me. I would love that.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Love, Nick</span></p>

<h1 class="post-title">Would you like to ask me a question?</h1>
<h3>NICOLA, WALLASEY, UK</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 class="post-title">[ ] I have come to believe that the right question is what we are really searching for, the answer may reveal itself if only we can find the right question. My question to you, then, is what is your question?</h1>
<h3>GEMMA, HOVE, UK</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Dear Dawne, Nicola and Gemma,</p>
<p>The question is the most valuable part of The Red Hand Files. Spend a moment to look inside most questions and you will find, embedded within, a supplementary enquiry that asks “Are you there?”</p>
<p>This would be my question too. “Are you there?”</p>
<p>Maybe the songs I’ve written over the years were febrile statements that have eventually turned into a solitary question. Maybe my songs used to say “Here I am”, demanding recognition. Now my songs ask “Are you there?”, longing for an answer.</p>
<p>Do I get sick and tired of the questions? The answer is no. In no way do I get sick and tired of the questions, because for me the questions are proof of life. Not only your lives, but of my own. Proof of existence. The questions are the answer, emerging from the impossible dark, at the edge of tears.</p>
<p>“Are you there?” I say.</p>
<p>“Yes, I am.” “Yes, I am.” “Yes, I am” they ask.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

<h3>MARK, KANSAS CITY, USA</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 class="post-title">[ ] I had a slight problem with your answer in that it felt like you were generalizing other meditative practices and, by doing so it seemed you were saying that TM is better than other practices. [ ]</h1>
<h3>LYDIA, ROCKVILLE, USA</h3>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Dear Nicola, Mark, Lydia and others,</span></p>
<p>Thank you for writing, I completely appreciate your points. As far as I am aware the TM organisation has a scaling system depending on what you are able to pay and your individual circumstances. Regardless, you are right TM is not free of charge and you will have to pay something.</p>
<p>I did not mean to discount other practices of meditation; there is an excellent app called Waking Up, where Sam Harris guides you through ten-minute Mindfulness meditations. Sam operates a refund system if you don’t find the introductory course valuable, additionally, if you would like to use his app but genuinely cannot afford it, he is happy to consider free access. Waking Up requires little commitment time-wise, yet is incredibly effective. I use it often, in conjunction with TM.</p>
<p>While I endorse meditation, I also understand the practice may not be for everyone. However, if you are interested there are various types of meditation and numerous apps and courses out there.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

<h3>MATTHAIS, FRANKFURT, GERMANY</h3>
</div>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Maia and Matthais, </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">The filmmaker, David Lynch, described the practice of Transcendental Meditation as catching the big fish. I read that he has been practising it since he had a breakdown around the time of making Eraserhead, over forty years ago. He claims he has never missed a meditation. If that is true, I am greatly impressed. The basics of TM are taught </span><span lang="EN-US">during a three session course</span><span lang="EN-US">, at the end of which your teacher gives </span><span lang="EN-US">you a personal mantra. Anyone can do it. It is effortless an</span><span lang="EN-US">d there is nothing to get right or wrong</span>. <span lang="EN-US">I have been practicing for around six years and found</span> <span lang="EN-US">it to be instantly and radically beneficial. So, to answer your question, Maia, from the first time I meditated, I stopped fearing the end of the world. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">I found that it also helps with low-level anger, uncommunicativeness, resentments, impatience, passive-aggression, depression, self-obsession, hatred of the worl</span><span lang="EN-US">d,</span><span lang="EN-US"> blaming others, wanting to murder and maim people and a host of other maladies that I had been dragging around and allowing to define me. Meditation modulated my calamitous internal thinking, and the freaked-out tyrant residing in my head that represented the worst possible version of myself was largely deposed.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">I also found those big fish down there in the depths, the deep creative ideas which David Lynch talks about, wild, bright and thrilling; but more importantly, I found a fundamental understanding of the next right thing to do, of making the choice of the least destructive course of action. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Unlike some meditation </span><span lang="EN-US">techniques that focus </span><span lang="EN-US">on a life lived entirely within the present moment, Transcendental Meditation seems to radiate backwards and forwards in time, evoking our common humanity and our deep connection to the earth’s inheritance, as it layers us in meaning. It may not hold back the end of the world, but it reduces the element of fear, allowing us to administer to the world more effectively. TM also implements a kind of mysterious reinstating of the soul, a honeying of life, a merciful acceptance of suffering, and reminds us of the incredible privilege it is to be alive. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="NL">Love, Nick</span></p>

<h1 class="post-title">What was your first date with your wife like?</h1>
<h3>VERA, MODENA, ITALY</h3>
</div>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Daniel,</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Shyness is the tentative sound of the orchestra tuning up before the symphony begins. It is a beautiful, fractured piece of music in itself. It is the orchestra attempting to find its shared intent and is over all too quickly if you ask me.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">In some circumstances shyness never finds its harmonic agreement and the situation will never be in tune. Yet shyness is a gift that can </span><span lang="EN-US">also be the sometimes crippling, often overpowering, intuition that the next thing life presents is potentially momentous</span><span lang="EN-US">, be it beautiful or devastating, where an exchanged few words or a gesture is a gateway to a new and unknown world.</span> <span lang="EN-US">From these intimations of excruciating clarity, we can fall through our shyness into moments of earth-shaking significance, and our lives can change completely.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">My wife, Susie, has a hummingbird shyness. In social situations she displays herself for a magical, weightless moment then darts away. It is as if she is so acutely tuned into the inherent discomfort of others, whether they display it or not, that the situation becomes </span><span lang="EN-US">overwhelming. She is a rare thing, an exhibitionist that hates to be seen.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">My initial dinner ‘</span><span lang="NL">date</span><span lang="EN-US">’ with Susie was an awkward and hesitant affair because we both intuited, on some deep level, that we stood at the threshold of another life that would stretch on indefinitely into the future. We did not know what that life would be, and it was undeclared between us, but our mutual shyness was the orchestra tuning up, with its flutters and discords, as it tried to find its shared melodic objective. In the end, I did what was a potentially life-deranging act and lunged hideously and impulsively through the membrane of our mutual shyness, grabbed my future wife and kissed her. She responded in kind and our shyness dropped away and, well, the symphony began. Shyness became the firewall through which we walked to a strange and different world, and here we are, together.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="NL">Love, Nick</span></p>

</div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><br />
Dear Will, Snorri and Stella,</span></p>
<p>One of the reasons I write is because it allows me the freedom to move beyond the declared world into the uncanny and unfamiliar world. As a songwriter I have made a commitment to uncertainty and to embrace that which I do not know, because I feel this is where true meaning exists. It allows me to write songs that have within them the spirit of enquiry and reciprocity. It leaves me open to chance, a sense of open-ended potentiality, and fills me with a devotion to the mystery of the world with its deep oceans and dark forests. This notion of uncertainty, of doubt, contains an enormous amount of creative power and is always accompanied by a state of yearning for something beyond certitude, beyond comprehension. My songs are essentially religious songs in that they hold within them a condition of longing for some approximation of Godliness.</p>
<p>But organised religion itself poses a huge problem for me. Even though it would be so much easier to doze off in the arms of a mutually decided truth, I find that, in most cases, structured systems of faith are specifically designed to switch off the apparatus of inquiry by presenting themselves as the ‘one true religion’. As a consequence, I am left feeling bored and cornered by the hubris of their own sureness.</p>
<p>I have always found great motivating energy in the idea that the thing I live my life yearning for, let’s call it God, in all probability does not exist. I feel my songs are conversations with the divine that might, in the end, be simply the babblings of a madman talking to himself. It is this thrilling uncertainty, this absurdity, from which all of my songs flow, and more than that, it is the way I live my life.</p>
<p>So, for me, Stella, living in a state of enquiry, neutrality and uncertainty, beyond dogma and grand conviction, is good for the business of songwriting, and for my life in general. This is the reason I tend to become uncomfortable around all ideologies that brand themselves as ‘the truth’ or ‘the way’. This not only includes most religions, but also atheism, radical bi-partisan politics or any system of thought, including ‘woke’ culture, that finds its energy in self-righteous belief and the suppression of contrary systems of thought. Regardless of the virtuous intentions of many woke issues, it is its lack of humility and the paternalistic and doctrinal sureness of its claims that repel me.</p>
<p>Antifa and the Far Right, for example, with their routine street fights, role-playing and dress-ups are participants in a weirdly erotic, violent and mutually self-sustaining marriage, propped up entirely by the blind, inflexible convictions of each other’s belief systems. It is good for nothing, except inflaming their own self-righteousness. The New Atheists and their devout opponents are engaged in the same dynamic. Wokeness, for all its virtues, is an ideology immune to the slightest suggestion that in a generation’s time their implacable beliefs will appear as outmoded and fallacious as those of their own former generation. <span lang="EN-US">This may well be the engine of progress, but history has a habit of embarrassing our treasured beliefs. </span><span lang="EN-US">Some of us, for example, are of the generation that believed that free speech was a clear-cut and uncontested virtue, yet within a generation this concept is seen by many as a dog-whistle to the Far Right, and is rapidly being consigned to the Left’s ever-expanding ideological junk pile. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">This is not to suggest we should not have our convictions or, indeed, that we should not be angry with the state of the world, or that we should not fight in order to correct the injustices committed against it. Conviction and anger can be the most powerful expressions of universal love. </span><span lang="EN-US">However, my duty as a songwriter is not to try to save the world, but rather to save the </span><em><span lang="EN-US">soul</span></em><span lang="EN-US"> of the world. This requires me to live my life on the other side of truth, beyond conviction and within uncertainty, where things make less sense, absurdity is a virtue and art rages and burns; where dogma is anathema, discourse is essential, doubt is an energy, magical thinking is not a crime and where possibility and potentiality rule. The answers to the secrets of the heart may just be there, in the inscrutable dark of the forest, in the unfathomable depths of the sea, at the uncertain tips of our fingers.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Love, Nick </span></p>

<p>Dear Barbara,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for entrusting me with such a courageous and heartfelt question. I took the liberty of discussing it with a number of my female friends and there was not one among them that was not greatly affected by your honesty and that did not understand exactly what you were talking about. It seems that you are not alone in finding the mirror your enemy, but you are unique in being so open and truthful about your relation to it.</p>
<p>For me, the question took me back to my adolescence and the troubled relationship I had with my own reflected image, and those nightmarish teenage years lived inside the pitiless mirror. I’m afraid to say this constant self-evaluation does not significantly decrease as you grow older, however it does become more manageable. I live mostly in hotels these days, and as I cautiously enter a different bathroom each night, with its angled mirrors and merciless lighting, I stand before the mirror at my most defenceless and exposed, and watch it do its worst. I often wonder how much accumulated misery a hotel mirror contains as it reflects back at us what appears to be our essential self. But, of course, what the mirror projects is not our true self at all but only our reflected outer-shell. What is virtually impossible to see within a mirror is that the very essence of our humanness, our vulnerability and fragility, is the most beautiful thing we possess.</p>
<p>Yet, when we are young that vulnerability can appear to us as shame or weakness, as we attempt to brace ourselves against what we may see as a brutal, unforgiving and judgemental world. But those who have no awareness of their own fragility, who present themselves as overconfident, armoured-up and invulnerable, sacrifice the essence of what makes them both human and beautiful.</p>
<p>Vulnerability is the very thing that permits us to connect with each other, to recognise in others the same discomfort they have with themselves and with their place in the world. Vulnerability is the engine of compassion, and can be a superpower, a special vision that allows us to see the quivering, wounded inner world that most of us possess.</p>
<p>Barbara, I am happy to hear that you have done important things as a 16 year old, because it is often what we <em>do</em> that moves our attention away from what we think we <em>are</em>, or the way that we think we look. The note of pride in your words could be the very thing that escorts you home, where you fall back through the reflected surface of your body, into your authentic self. Your pain-filled question holds great hope because in order to connect meaningfully with the world we need to have some understanding of its innate tragedy. Paradoxically, the fragility of your question is its immense strength and says something very profound about you as a person; something very beautiful shines through its unhappy words. That body that you ‘can’t see anything positive in’ holds within it an unusually courageous, honest and intelligent heart. Your question is a testament to your specialness, and by asking it you have touched us all.</p>
<p>Finally, you asked what you could do, how to behave. Please, take care of yourself. Seek out beautiful things, inspirations, connections and validating friends. Perhaps you could keep a journal and write stuff down. The written word can put to rest many imagined demons. Identify things that concern you in the world and make incremental efforts to remedy them. At all costs, try to cultivate a sense of humour. See things through that courageous heart of yours. Be merciful to yourself. Be kind to yourself. Be kind.</p>
<p>With love, Nick</p>

<h1 class="post-title">How do we say goodbye?</h1>
<h3>ELSE, LONDON, UK</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Robin and Else,</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">There is always a temptation to take the position that one has no regrets. There is a death row defiance to this notion that stares down the accusations of the past and says, ‘I am what I am and be damned’. We feel that to harbour regrets dishonours the very place to which we have arrived. But, it can be helpful to remind ourselves that these regrets are intimations informing us that we have developed sufficiently to perceive the nature of our past shortcomings. Regret can be a sorrowing hope that sees the faults of the past through the more lucid and open eyes of the present. They are growing pains as we become better at being ourselves. Most of our past mistakes are consistent with our personal evolution at that time, and the waves of regret simply signal a progression and expansion of our hearts.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Perhaps it is useful to see our lives as a series of failed or abandoned dreams, but to also recognise that these dreams are the very architecture of our humanity; to lovingly accept our shortcomings and lay them to rest in the knowledge that growth and regret go hand in hand, as do failure and potentiality. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Many of the regrets I have today seem to revolve around my past inability to say goodbye. For many years my way of dealing with things was to cut and run and not look back. I was forever fleeing from something or someone or some place, a disastrous situation, for example, or my various addictions or ruined relationships. This state of flight felt like a creative, motivating force, yet was actually completely devoid of reflection, and certainly unimpeded by the corrective influence of regret. I felt that if I ever stopped I would be eaten alive by the chaos that followed me around like a stray dog. It took many years before I found the resolve to turn around and stare down the imagined monster of my past. I found, when I finally looked, many ancient and festering wounds that a timely and heartfelt goodbye could well have healed. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Over time I have learned that the opportunity to say goodbye is the ultimate privilege. It can serve as a sigh of remembered love, a reparative breath that precedes an adjournment, a pause of gratitude before you inhabit the next you. To say goodbye, as difficult as it can be, must be seen as a gesture of reverence to the passage of life because there are many to whom this opportunity is denied, with devastating effect. There are those who are snatched away who never had the opportunity to comprehend the immense significance of their lives, and there are those left behind who stand yearning before a vacuum, paralysed in an eternal farewell that can never be spoken. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">So, to your question, Else, how <em>do</em> we say goodbye? We summon the courage by understanding that to say goodbye is an act of appreciation for the past that we have moved beyond, and a prelude to the new you that will, in time, require its own goodbye, and as you continue to grow, further goodbyes, each a rehearsal for the final, most precious goodbye of all. The way to say goodbye is to turn and face the past and administer the word as an offering of gratitude and also a healing gesture of mercy, and simply say it. Goodbye. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Love, Nick.</span></p>

					<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Liii,</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">I am sorry I have taken so long to answer this question. You sent it to </span><em><span lang="DE">The Red Hand Files</span></em><span lang="EN-US"> almost nine months ago and I have carried it with me all this time, wanting to answer, but never quite knowing how. I think this little question has stayed with me, not just because of the lovely beat of pathos in it, but also because of its extraordinary existential reach. It seemed that it spoke to all of us, yet it felt simply beyond me to answer. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Aloneness and loneliness are two very different things, of course. I spend much of my time alone; I always have. I have learnt that being alone, as bereft as it perhaps feels to some, is busy with meaning and disclosure. For me, it is an essential place that intensifies the essence of oneself, in all its rampant need. It is the site of demons and sudden angels and raw truths; a quiet, haunted place and a place of unforeseen understandings. A place of unmasking and unveiling. It can be industrious or melancholic or frightening, sometimes all at the same time, yet within it there is a feeling of a latent promise that holds great power. Like Jesus praying alone in the garden, or Mary Magdalene alone at the mouth of Christ’s tomb, aloneness holds moments that tremble on the brink of revelation and great change.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">And then there is loneliness, which is aloneness without choice, an enforced condition that yearns for recognition, to be seen and to be heard. This brave and unguarded admission appears to be the aching heart of your question. As I sat on the plane travelling to Reykjavik for the last show of my ‘In Conversation’ tour, I felt suddenly that there was something I could say to you. Having spent much time travelling on this tour alone, it struck me that your question didn’t have to be answered, but simply acknowledged; that to reach out to you, as you reached out to me, could in itself be the answer and, perhaps, a remedy – to say to you, you are not alone, we are here, and that we, a multitude, are thinking of you. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="NL">Love, Nick</span></p>

<p>Dear Hannah,</p>
<p><strong>WIFE WITH EYES CLOSED  </strong></p>
<p>She sleeps and dreams to be before<br />
She seems to go there more and more<br />
She turns her back but not with any malice</p>
<p>She says she dreams of beasts run wild<br />
That circle around a rainbow child<br />
Cavorting through a many-roomed palace</p>
<p>And sometimes a black witch flies by<br />
With a wrath that blackens the entire sky<br />
The beasts all watch through a special telescope</p>
<p>And in time I leave her there and go<br />
To the world clawing against the window<br />
Hey, I’m not saying there isn’t any hope</p>
<p>For I can see a moment in between<br />
The waking horror and the sleeping dream<br />
Where the world and she are breathless beautiful<br />
Where the world and she are breathless beautiful</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

					<p>Dear Circium,</p>
<p>Tom Waits famously wrote “You are innocent when you dream”, yet dreams are not nearly as innocent as they seem. Neither are songs nor poetry. Songwriting and poetry are perilous callings, full of intrigue and infidelity. They are covert undertakings that creep around our deepest and most hazardous needs. They are not for the squeamish or the eager to please.</p>
<p>I believe you when you say you don’t want to sleep with the ‘lusty girl on the train’ – the problem is what you want to do is actually <em>worse</em>. You want to write a <em>poem</em> about her. To write a song or a poem about another human being can be one of the most intensely intimate acts a person can perform, it is an act of profound, unblinking contemplation, a near religious meditation on that moment of carnal recognition.</p>
<p>Listen to Patti Smith’s version of ‘Gloria’, where she has taken Van Morrison’s already wolfish classic and expanded it into a supercharged religious rumination on lust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>I look out the window</em></p>
<p><em>See a sweet young thing</em></p>
<p><em>Humpin&#8217; on the parking meter</em></p>
<p><em>Leanin&#8217; on the parking meter</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patti Smith’s ‘Gloria’ is not concerned so much with the actual sexual encounter, but rather with the brutal carnality and religious ecstasy of language itself. It is one of the most demented displays of predatory sexual desire ever recorded. Yet, it is beyond sex. It is even beyond worship. <em>It is poetry</em>. The “sweet young thing” that is “humpin&#8217; on the parking meter” is your “lusty girl on a train”.</p>
<p>Gloria, Peggy Sue, Billie Jean, Angie, Delilah, Fernando, Jolene, Ruby, Maggie May, Chuck E., Sharona, Sara, Suzanne, Sweet Caroline and, indeed, Deanna – these names live on, as sacrificial lambs, compulsively sexualised in our collective consciousness.</p>
<p>My song ‘Deanna’ was seen as a particularly brutal act of betrayal, and thirty years on I still haven’t been fully forgiven. I console myself with the thought that I was unflinching in my duties as a songwriter and in doing so wrote a song that brought joy to the lives of many, even though it broke a heart (or two) in the process.</p>
<p>From one wordsmith to another, and from someone who has spent a considerable amount of a long and contentious career in the songwriter’s doghouse, that’s the name of the game, Circium. Harsh as it is, we spend our lives walking on the hearts and messy eggshells we have smashed in order to make the omelet that feeds the multitudes.</p>
<p>I can perfectly understand why you want your girlfriend to read your stuff, as we poets and songwriters often have little else to offer than our words, and of course our perverse little truths. However, your poems are intimations of an eroticized and imaginative adventure of which your partner is excluded. It’s little wonder she might be reluctant to get involved.</p>
<p>Having said that, over time I have discovered great poetic and personal value in writing about the familiar, that which is in front of you, that which you see every day, that which sleeps beside you, for often that quotidian presence is the most extraordinarily complex and dangerous thing of all. It holds a looking glass up to beautiful and terrible truths that live inside us. As we look into our lover’s eyes and see our reflected selves, our courage as writers is tested and enlarged.</p>
<p>The girl on the train will always be there, forever travelling through that imaginative space, but maybe the challenge for you as a poet lies within the intricate wonder of the one who sits before you. She is, after all, your mirror.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

					<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Mel,</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Forgiveness is a form of self-rescue that goes, at times, against our very nature. Forgiveness can prevent us from becoming the living definition of the injury that has been inflicted upon us &#8211; from being consumed by anger, pain, resentment and bitterness. But how difficult it is to sometimes forgive; how unfair it seems to reward offence with compassion. Yet, despite our intuitions, despite the seeming insanity of the enterprise, we must try, because forgiveness can be the way to self-preservation. Forgiveness is an act of self-love where the malignancy you have endured can become the motivating force that helps enlarge the capacity of the heart.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">How to forgive the unforgivable? Now there is a question. Sometimes we feel the crime is such a violation, and so egregious, that it is beyond absolution &#8211; but the struggle to forgive is where it can find its true meaning. Even the attempt to move toward forgiveness allows us the opportunity to touch the borders of grace. To try is an act of resistance against the forces of malevolence &#8211; a form of </span><em><span lang="FR">defian</span></em><em><span lang="EN-US">t grace.</span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">There are some who have found ways to forgive all manner of horrors and we look at them with awe. In Michigan, recently, a mother stood in court and told the murderer of her 17-year-old son. “I forgive you from the bottom of my heart. I pray for you as a mother. You are a child to me.” The mother of one of the victims of the Manchester bombing also publicly forgave the murderer of her child. These are forms of defiant grace, by people who refuse to be bowed by the malevolence of the world, and who rise to heights of compassion way beyond the reach of most of us, their acts of forgiveness a saintlike mixture of beauty, lunacy and courage.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">So, Mel, how do you forgive the one you love for doing something truly terrible? I would try to see the idea of forgiveness as an act of insubordination, a non-compliance to the forces of malevolence, a recognition that you will not be defined by the offence that has been inflicted upon you. See forgiveness as a gift, not to the person who has committed the injury, but to yourself, in the form of self-protection. The sooner you start the process, the less time you may spend imprisoned by resentment and bitterness, hopefully moving toward a more resilient self. To try and fail is in itself a form of betterment. There are times forgiveness is beyond us but still we must reach, still we must strive.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="NL">Love, Nick</span></p>

<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Ramon and Tanya,</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">The truth of the matter is</span> <span lang="EN-US">that I didn’t give up on PJ Harvey, PJ Harvey gave up on me. There I am, sitting on the floor of my flat in Notting Hill, sun streaming through the window (maybe), feeling good, with a talented and beautiful young singer for a girlfriend, when the phone rings. I pick up the phone and it’s Polly.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">“Hi,” I say</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">“I want to break up with you.”  </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">“Why?!” I ask.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">“It’s just over,” she says.  </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">I was so surprised I almost dropped my syringe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA" style="text-align: center;"><span lang="EN-US">***</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Deep down I suspected that drugs might have been a problem between us, but there were other things too. I still had a certain amount of work to do on</span> <span lang="EN-US">my understanding of the concept of monogamy, and Polly had her own issues, I suspect, but I think at the end of the day it came down to the fact that we were both fiercely creative people, each too self-absorbed to ever be able to inhabit the same space in any truly meaningful way. We were like two lost matching suitcases, on a carousel going nowhere.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Songwriting completely consumed me at that time. It was not what I did, but what I was. It was the very essence of me. Polly’s commitment to her own work was probably as narcissistic and egomaniacal as my own, although I was so deep into my own shit that I can’t really comment on this with any certainty. I remember our time together with great fondness though, they were happy days, and the phone call hurt;</span> <span lang="EN-US">but never one to waste a good crisis, I set about completing <em>The Boatman’s Call.</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA" style="text-align: center;"><span lang="EN-US">***</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">The Boatman’s Call</span></em><span lang="EN-US"> cured me of Polly Harvey. It also changed the way I made music. The record was an artistic rupture in itself, to which I owe a great debt. It was the compensatory largesse for a broken heart, or at least what I thought at the time was a broken heart – in recent years I have re-evaluated that term. The break up filled me with a lunatic energy that gave me the courage to write songs about commonplace human experiences (like broken hearts) openly, boldly and with meaning – a kind of writing that I had, until that date, steered clear of, feeling a need to instead conceal my personal experiences in character-driven stories</span><span lang="EN-US">.</span><span lang="EN-US"> It was a growth spurt that pushed me in a direction and style of songwriting that has remained with me ever since – albeit in different guises. It also pointed a way to a more poignant, raw, stripped back way of performance – the suspended and barely supported vocal. The Bad Seeds, to their eternal credit, stepped back and just let these piano-driven songs be. There are few bands on earth that understand that to <em>not</em> play, can be as important as its opposite.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Tanya, maybe it is a combination of all of these elements that changed the way you felt about The Bad Seeds’ music.</span> <span lang="EN-US">Perhaps there is also a feminine energy within <em>The Boatman’s Call</em> which you respond to. It feels a wiser, more empathetic record than anything that had been done previously, but whatever the reason, I am happy that you were drawn into the fold. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Love, Nick</span></p>

					<p>Dear Lisa,</p>
<p>There is great danger in asking a songwriter to explain their songs – or at least to make the assumption that their interpretation is in some way more valid or true than your own. This is simply not the case. I believe the fan often has a deeper understanding of a given song than its creator. Sometimes, I feel that I am the last to know what one of my own songs actually means. Sometimes, they take many years to reveal themselves. With that in mind, as you’ve asked, I will tell you what I think is going on in ‘Rings of Saturn’. I only hope my answer does not diminish the value of the song for you.</p>
<p>Warren emailed me a simple circular chord pattern that we had improvised in the studio. He liked its lo-fi, joyful feel. Sitting at the kitchen table, and using the Voice Memo App on my iPhone, I freestyled a lyric over the top and pinged it back to Warren.</p>
<p>Like several of the songs from <em>Skeleton Tree</em>, because the lyrics are essentially improvised, they tend to be ambiguous, unguarded, and to a certain extent, beyond my control. This, I believe, gives these particular songs their reckless power.</p>
<p>Listening to it now it seems the song is in three distinct parts. In the first verse, the narrator is involved in a sexual encounter with a woman, who is consumed by her own promiscuity. By using a voyeuristic cascade of erotic images – “upside down and inside out”, “like a funnel web”, “skinny white haunches high and skyward”, “black oily gash”, “crawling backwards”, “wet black fur” – the narrator propels the sexual encounter from the mundane, into the deep space of the imagination – “above the shops, the crowds, the cars and the town” – to the place where true sexual expression exists.</p>
<p>The chorus that follows suggests that, through this encounter the woman manifests her essential nature – “this is exactly what she was born to be” – and by implication, so too does the man. The euphoric lift of the chords on the chorus gives this notion a joyously old school and consensually abandoned feel.</p>
<p>The second verse then shifts into something different, and as the encounter becomes more surreal – “the air buckles and rushes in”, “her body moon-blue as a jellyfish” – the lyric turns its concerns away from the act itself, to the inability of the songwriter to do justice to the essentialness of this elemental moment. There are things beyond art that are carnal and godless, and the disempowered writer “spurts his ink across the sheets”, leaving her “completely unexplained”, and abandons himself to the servitude of her imperial feminine potential.</p>
<p>This time the chorus presents the woman as the divine force, beyond explanation, beyond description. She just cosmically <em>is.</em></p>
<p>In the third and final verse, the real world comes rushing back, and the woman rises from her bed. We see she is a mother, “stepping over piles of sleeping children”, as she reinstates herself to the chosen function of her womanhood – the nurturer, the provider, the font of life. As the sleeping children, born of this creative act, dream their innocent dreams, the mother ascends into the melancholy splendour of the cosmos and “dangles herself from the rings of Saturn” – in recognition of both the joy and sorrow of womanhood.</p>
<p>I love to perform it live because the rising, building chords take us to a place of collective bliss – of tearful, hopeful and mutually transcendent love. I suspect, Lisa, this is what you felt, that made you feel so emotional. I hope so.</p>
<p>When Warren received the iPhone recording I sent to him, he responded immediately. “A <em>fucking</em> classic.” The whole exchange took fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

<h1 class="post-title">My husband died some years ago but I feel him all around. How can this be?</h1>
<h3>MALINA, ATHENS, GREECE</h3>
</div>
<div>
Dear Aylyn and Malina,</p>
<p>Far be it from us to believe in signs; far be it from us to believe in spirits; far be it from us to intuit indications that the universe is not as it seems or, worse, that the dead are trying to tell us something – oh no! – because that would make us delusional (Richard Dawkins) or intellectually dishonest (Sam Harris) or in denial of death (Ernest Becker) or unreasonable (Steven Pinker) or cowardly (Bertrand Russell) or stupid (Ricky Gervais) or woo-woo (George from Alabama) – and we can’t have that! Yet here we are, with these lurking suspicions, these hunches, all around us. What do we do with them?</p>
<p>Often, while grieving, many of us are gripped by a form of madness, and start to believe, against our better judgments, all manner of lunacies and magical thinking; we believe our loved ones visit us in our dreams, we see them across crowded rooms, we think we hear their voices, we believe they inhabit other forms, we feel their ghost-hands in our own, we experience their presence &#8220;all around&#8221;.</p>
<p>These uncomfortable intuitions are confessed, in hushed and furtive tones, with a certain embarrassment, because we remember a time when we were rational people, a time when we thought there was some logical system to the universe, when we could believe in the protective power of reason, when the world made sense – and we realise that to admit to these intuitions may appear deluded or, worse, feeble-minded.</p>
<p>Two days after our son died, Susie and I went to the cliff where he fell. Now, when Arthur was a small child, he always, always, had a thing about ladybird beetles. He loved them. He drew them. He identified with them. He constantly talked about them. As we sat there, a ladybird landed on Susie’s hand. We both saw it, but said nothing, because even though we recognised the sad significance of it, we were not about to belittle the enormity of the tragedy with some sentimental display of magical thinking. But we were new to grief. We were unaware of grief’s particular appetites. When we returned home, as I was opening the door to our house, another ladybird landed on my hand. Since then Susie and I see ladybirds everywhere. When Warren and I were working on the last album a plague of ladybirds came into the studio. I don’t know what to make of this phenomenon, but each time I see a ladybird I receive a kind of jolt of recognition that maybe something is at play within the world that is beyond my comprehension, even though it is, in all probability, just ladybird season.</p>
<p>This need to believe in something beyond ourselves is a basic human function. Humans are essentially religious creatures by nature; we are possessed by inclinations and intuitions that are at odds with the rational world. For some of us, this is not simply wishful thinking or lack of nerve or being &#8220;stupid&#8221;, but a survival instinct that can bring great meaning to our lives, whether or not it conforms to the facts.</p>
<p>So, Aylyn, do I believe in signs? Well, I prefer to say that I have made, for reasons of survival, a commitment to the uncertain nature of the world. This is where my heart lies. I suspect it always has. And, Malina, I am joined in this enterprise by a legion of fellow grievers, many of us deranged by loss, and embarrassed by our sentimental inclinations. We tread gently around each other’s irrationalities because we know they are the fragile foundations of our vacillating sanity. You may hear some people say that feelings are not facts, but this is untrue. Feelings, to some, are facts. Sometimes these intuitions hold more truth than the rational world can ever hope to offer – when we are faced with a world that has long since stopped making sense and, indeed, lost its reason.</p>
<p>I think we disregard our intuitions at our peril. If you are left feeling the world is more mysterious than you perhaps once thought, and this feeling provides you with some sort of comfort, I would move toward the meaning, in whatever form it presents itself, because meaning is the antidote to despair, and, well, sometimes meaning can feel in scant supply and despair seems all around. My advice to the both of you is quietly, covertly, embrace the mystery that presents itself. It is yours alone.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

<p>Dear Piers,</p>
<p>As I write, I am wearing an ancient Sonic Youth <em>Goo</em> T-shirt from 1990, back when I was in Thurston Moore’s good books. I also own a very beautiful Flatbush Zombies T-shirt, bought around the release of their first album. A few years ago the Zombies and I attempted a collaboration and I sent them my version of the T. Rex classic, <em>Cosmic Dancer</em>. They said they “could not relate to it” but they radically pitch-shifted my voice, sampled it and used it anyway, as the percussive heartbeat to an extraordinarily wild and fucked-up piece of hip-hop that neither of us released. I have a series of very lovely Current 93/David Tibet T-shirts, and a tote bag and some weird little esoteric Tibet pin things, all based on his visionary artwork. When I first came to London, David gave me an education in Christian mysticism, as we bonded over Spanish wine and our love of the artist Louis Wain. I also possess several ruined Dirty Three T-shirts featuring Mick Turner’s lovely mythic paintings – <em>and</em> a silver plastic Dirty Three sheriff’s badge, which I treasure because it is arguably the crappiest piece of merchandise ever made, but is a powerful emblem of the bad old days. I have an unused Dirty Three <em>Ocean Songs</em> tea towel – oh wow! a goldfinch just landed on my windowsill! – and Warren’s favourite AC/DC T-shirt, which I borrowed from him about twenty-five years ago and have still not returned. I also have an amazing T-shirt which Susie gave to me that says &#8220;Beyoncé Wasn’t Built in a Day&#8221;<em>, </em>although I suspect this is a bootleg. My favourite and most treasured piece of merchandise, though, is an original Elvis <em>Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite </em>T-shirt, sent to me by someone who claimed to have actually been at the concert in 1973. These items, Piers, are just the tip of a terrifying and deeply nostalgic iceberg – but a T-shirt, a pair of socks, a tea towel, a badge, it’s all essentially banal merchandise.</p>
<p>However, banal and as exploitative as these things may be, I value some of them hugely, and if there were a fire in my house they could quite possibly be the first things I would grab after the dogs. They have immense sentimental value, they are attached to certain times, people, places and things I love, and are enormously meaningful. I have a feeling that, similarly, many other music lovers have a T-shirt, a pair of socks or a hoodie that they value, and wear with a kind of reverence, not just for the artist, but for their own past – a past that, like their T-shirt, is old, faded, full of holes and beloved memories.</p>
<p>So, Piers, to answer your question would I wear a pair of merch socks myself? The answer is well, yeah, I do – when I do Jane Fonda’s Workout with my wife, I wear a pair of Radiohead compression socks, RiRi sweatpants, a Leather Nun T-shirt and a Dire Straits headband. I am a star jumping, butt clenching dervish of banality and exploitation. Look at me now!</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>
<p>P.S. Piers, I just got your very sweet follow-up letter. No offence taken!</p>

<h3>LAURA, NICE, FRANCE</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Dear David and Laura,</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Recently, I watched the movie </span><em>Mandy</em><span lang="EN-US"> with my sons </span>– <span lang="EN-US">a terrifying but beautiful film. The song </span>‘<span lang="ES-TRAD">Starless</span>’ <span lang="EN-US">by King Crimson was used to great effect during the opening credits. My sons agreed that this was an amazing song, which made me happy because when I was a teenager I was a huge King Crimson fan. King Crimson was able to combine extraordinary moments of purity and fragility with super heavy rock </span>‘n’ <span lang="EN-US">roll, and maybe they imprinted somewhere in my mind the template for some of the more schizophrenic Bad Seeds songs. King Crimson were masters of the sudden violent eruption. Bill Bruford, their drummer was simply off the planet and Robert Fripp was my favourite guitarist at the time, along with, of course, David Gilmour. As a teenager, I was a big English progressive </span><span lang="EN-US">rock fan. Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Procol Harum, Yes, Emerson, Lake and Palmer </span>– <span lang="EN-US">I loved that stuff. I still do. To this day, Robert Fripp and David Gilmour are giants to me, and remain among my favourite guitarists. Fripp and Gilmour are very different players but there is something about the tone of their instruments that touches me in a very deep place. The same goes for Funkadelic&#8217;s Eddie Hazel (check out Maggot Brain!). These guitarists play as if they are singing, I think. Tonally and emotionally, David Gilmour</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s guitar is simply a supercharged version of his voice </span>– <span lang="EN-US">satiny, stirring and epic. Robert Fripp</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s guitar sound is more radical, dangerous and unpredictable, but even at his most confrontational that lyrical and songlike quality is never far away.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">In 2010, Grinderman recorded a song called </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Heathen Child</span>’ <span lang="EN-US">for the </span><em>Grinderman 2</em><span lang="EN-US"> album (part of </span>a yet to be<span lang="EN-US"> completed trilogy, you might be happy to know) and we invited Robert Fripp to play on the extended version. This version, called </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Super Heathen Child</span>’<span lang="EN-US">, is Grinderman at their very best. I felt as though Grinderman was laying claim to their roots. Many music critics thought that Grinderman was a return to the sound of The Birthday Party, but I never understood that. </span><span lang="EN-US">From my own perspective within the band, Grinderman was much more influenced by the British progressive rock of my youth than anything else</span><span lang="EN-US"> (except Miles Davis&#8217; late electronic period, perhaps). </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Super Heathen Child</span>’ <span lang="EN-US">continues to have an extraordinary hold over me, and contains within it a deep emotional pull because it is attached directly to my adolescence. Listening to it, I have that strange dizzying feeling a dream has when it suddenly becomes a reality; all that deep concentrated listening I did when I was a teenager manifesting itself over forty years later in a Fripp solo that just blows the mind. Recording with Robert Fripp remains one of the seismic events of my life. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">So, to answer your question, Laura, encouraged by my sons</span>’ <span lang="EN-US">appreciation for </span>‘<span lang="ES-TRAD">Starless</span>’ <span lang="EN-US">by King Crimson in the film <em>Mandy</em>, I did something that I very rarely do. I played one of my songs to my children. I put </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">Super Heathen Child</span>’ <span lang="EN-US">by Grinderman (featuring Robert Fripp</span><span lang="EN-US">) on the record player and cranked it all the way up, and well, Laura, it sounded good, and they seemed to really like it; and I was </span><em>proud.</em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="NL">Love, Nick</span></p>

<h1 class="post-title">Do you ever get tired of all the pretentious fat lesbians who enjoy your music? Personally I enjoy a lot of your music, but I find most of your fans insufferable. I&#8217;m just wondering if you&#8217;re on the same page.</h1>
<h3>GEORGE, ALABAMA, USA</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Jessica and George,</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Jesus said on the cross, “Forgive them for they know not what they do.” George, I think Jesus may have been talking directly to you.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Some weeks ago, I answered a question at one of my “In Conversation” events. I was defending people’s right to say what they wanted. I was defending people’s right to offend. In short, I was defending the idea of free speech. It seems that these days free speech has fallen out of favour. The concept has been polarised by some and now a free speech advocate is often seen – I feel somewhat bizarrely – to be aligned to the </span><span lang="EN-US">far-right. However, I do believe that, even though we should have the right to say what we like, there are consequences to what we say and just because we can speak freely, </span><span lang="EN-US">it does not – and should not – inoculate us against these consequences.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">This is why it is important to think something through before sending those thoughts out into the world. When I set about answering a question on <em>The Red Hand Files</em>, I find it helpful to write my thoughts down before I formulate them into an answer. This scrutiny has its purpose, because it helps me to see where my thinking could be dishonest, unhelpful and damaging. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">So, in the interests of free speech, George, I have given you a platform. However, and I am </span><span lang="PT">speculat</span><span lang="EN-US">ing here, I think that probably </span><span lang="EN-US">ninety-nine percent of the people who read your question will think that you are being, well, a bit of an asshole. I could be wrong. It could be more. Now, you may say &#8220;So what? No one knows who I am. How can this possibly hurt me?&#8221; You may say that. But you would be wrong. I do not believe that your anonymity protects you, any more than I believe the anonymity of the hate trolls on social media protects them. I feel that there are psychic pathways that exist between us all, and that the negativity we create eventually finds its way back to us.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">The opportunity to </span><span lang="EN-US">act in a better way is one that is continuously afforded to us – to try </span><span lang="EN-US">to make the next thing we do the best thing, rather than </span><span lang="EN-US">the worst thing, the destructive thing. In this instance, George, it’s not too late for you. If you close your eyes and apologise to my fans, just maybe that negative attention will begin to dissipate. I think </span><span lang="EN-US">my fans are smart enough and sufficiently forgiving to understand that your words extend only to the margins of your own individual evolution.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">When Jesus said, “Forgive them for they know not what they </span><span lang="PT">do.</span><span lang="EN-US">” He meant that there is room for everyone to become better, every single one of us, because all of us really, “know not what we do.” We understand ourselves only to the limits of our own personal development as human beings. Yet, we can go further than that.</span><span lang="EN-US"> There is always room to evolve, to become better at being human, and to advance the common cause of humanity and civility – this applies not just to you, George, but to me too and, </span><span lang="NL">indeed, </span><span lang="EN-US">to all of us. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">With love, Nick</span></p>

					<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Dear K,</span></p>
<p class="BodyAA"><span lang="EN-US">I read about the death of your son in the paper. I am so very sorry. Thank you for your letter &#8211; it was honest, searching and beautifully articulated. I think that it is better not to publish it in full though, so as not to rekindle any attention that could cause unnecessary suffering for you and your family. I hope you don’t mind.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">You talked about the story of Pinocchio, a story I love very much. I included it as one of my favourite books in a recent Red Hand File. Geppetto, the maker and father of the puppet-boy Pinocchio, trapped in the darkened belly of the beast, is a very powerful metaphor for the father who has been separated from his child – the grieving father. The epic story of the incorrigible Pinocchio’s attempt at reuniting with his father and becoming a real boy is one of the most moving in all literature. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">We grieving fathers, all of us, begin our </span><span lang="EN-US">time in the vast and darkened belly of the beast. We also have become the child, as you said</span> <span lang="EN-US">in your letter – and perhaps some dark force had always destined that to be. For a while we become the one that died, as we are plunged into a darkness from which there seems no escape. But you also mentioned the inability of the child to save the father from ‘the abyss’ if the child has died. Eventually, I found this not to be true. I found the </span><em><span lang="IT">spirit</span></em><span lang="EN-US"> of my son was ultimately able to release me from this terrible place. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">The spirits of our children can become the guides that eventually lead us out of the dark. After a while, I found the spirit of my son</span> <span lang="EN-US">braved the sea and found and entered the whale, and lighting the fire, convulsed the whale and released me from </span><span lang="EN-US">its unlit interior, ‘blasting me ashore’. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Most of the </span><span lang="EN-US">time, these days, I feel on solid ground and in the air and the light. But the process has been slow. You are in your very early days. It is four years to the day for me, yet still my son comes to the rescue – parenting me, <em>fathering </em>me, as the darkness reasserts itself. Yet I see a day when my son can let go of my hand and return to his spirit-form – the child – and be free. I can become his father again. That day is coming, but is not </span><span lang="EN-US">here yet, for you or for me. We are still, as you said, on some level, ‘living in another world’ with the departed. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">I read Pinocchio again this week, after you wrote to me – I hadn’t read it since the death of my son – and I found it very helpful. What a deep little book it is. These stories talk to us, down the ages, and give us powerful images that can articulate our deepest feelings and help make some sense of things. Thank you for reminding me of it and, again, I am so sorry to hear about your little boy. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="NL">Love, Nick</span></p>

					<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Gianelli,</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">I love this despairing and soulful question so much. I have put it in verse form and changed the spacing so that it behaves as a poem, rather than a question, as it rises hauntingly from the dark. I hope you don’t mind. I will do my best to answer it.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Firstly, do I pray with my family and friends? The answer is sadly no. My family,</span> <span lang="EN-US">and especially my friends, are mostly not the praying types, and I’m not sure they would know who to pray to if they were  – apart that is from darling Susie, my wife. Susie prays a lot, I think, but alone, I would say, terribly alone. I do pray myself – and I also meditate; prayer and meditation are different practices but they serve a similar function. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Do I hope someone listens to my prayers – to my inner voice? Well, I don’t know where my prayers go. I don’t know if anyone is listening. However, I still kneel down alone and pray. My prayers mostly revolve around the wellbeing of the ones I love, because I feel, possibly erroneously, that the world aligns itself in such a way that it draws those I send my prayers to closer to me. I feel, without any evidence to suggest that this is true, that the people I pray for benefit from my prayers, as if the energy of my prayers travels along streams of collective goodness that connect us all in some way, in a sort of humanistic cooperation of light and compassion.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Do I get guidance from prayer and meditation? The answer is certainly, yes. After applying my full attention to whatever it is I am praying about – and to whoever it is I am praying to –</span> <span lang="EN-US">I feel that I simply know how to proceed</span> <span lang="EN-US">in a rightful way; one that causes the least harm to myself and to others.</span> <span lang="EN-US">I feel less a victim of the endless self-defeating thoughts that can go on in my mind, and instead I feel a quietness and clarity of thought.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Is this world cruel? I don’t think so. I think this world is indifferent and indifference is not cruelty. What connects me to you, Gianelli, and you to every other sentient being in the universe, is that the universe, simply does not care about us; it does not act with malice or desire to harm us – it is simply unaffected by our condition. If one acknowledges this state of affairs, then it sets up a situation that allows us to make a simple choice – either we respond to the indifference of the universe with self-pity and narcissism – as if the world has in some way personally betrayed us – and live our lives in a cynical, pessimistic and self-serving manner; or we stand tall, set our eyes clearly upon this unfeeling universe and <em>love it all the same</em> – even though, or especially because, it doesn’t love us. This act of cosmic defiance, of subversive optimism, of unconditional and insubordinate love, is the greatest act of human beauty we can perform. To stand before this great, blank, heartless cosmic event and say: ‘<em>We believe in you’. ‘We love you’. ‘We care for you’</em>. This is the definition of grace, Gianelli, and this is the epiphany you speak of. We create our own divinity, our own Godliness, through our ferocious need. We yearn the heavens awake, and if we are quiet, in prayer or in meditation, sometimes we can feel the heavens stirring, breathing our fragile and reckless love back through us.  </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Thank you for your question.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Love, Nick</span></p>

<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">I read somewhere that between the ages of seventeen and twenty-four our brains are super-receptive, and that it is the period when we form acutely close attachments to things </span>– <span lang="EN-US">songs, books, films, paintings etc. </span>– <span lang="EN-US">that will be the guiding lights that lead us through the rest of our lives.</span> <span lang="ES-TRAD">So, Alejandr</span>á<span lang="EN-US">, Eva and Marat, you are all in those bright and shining years where you should absorb as much art as possible. Drink it up, while the thrill is there, whenever and wherever you can, because as the years go on, that flush of wonder may subside, as we direct our attention to our own work.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">As with the other lists I have posted here on <em>The Red Hand Files,</em> this is in no way definitive and by no means reflects the </span>‘<span lang="EN-US">best</span>’ <span lang="EN-US">books I have read, nor are these necessarily the greatest books by the particular author I have chosen, but here are a dozen books of fiction that I love. Most of them I read when I was a quite young, and each of them introduced me to worlds that were strange and fascinating and new. I hope you like them. </span></p>

					<p><span lang="EN-US">Dear Mark,</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">I understand it is very difficult when an artist you admire reveals something about themselves which you feel casts an unhappy shadow across their work &#8211; and this is by no means exclusive to Morrissey. It happens all the time and I have talked a little about this in a previous issue of The Red Hand Files. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">I think perhaps it would be helpful to you if you saw the proprietorship of a song in a different way. Personally, when I write a song and release it to the public,</span> <span lang="EN-US">I feel</span> <span lang="EN-US">it stops being <em>my </em>song. It has been offered up to my audience and they, if they care to, take possession of that song and become its custodian. The integrity of the song now rests not with the artist, but with the listener. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">When I listen to a beloved song &#8211; Neil Young’s ‘On the Beach’, for instance &#8211; I feel, at my very core, that that song is speaking to me and to me alone, that I have taken possession of that song exclusively. I feel, beyond all rationality, that the song has been written with me in mind and, as it weaves itself into the fabric of my life, I become its steward, understanding it better than anybody else ever could. I think we all can relate to this feeling of owning a song. This is the singular beauty of music.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Perhaps it doesn’t matter what Neil Young’s personal conduct may be like therefore, or Morrissey’s, as they have handed over ownership of the songs to their audience. Their views and behaviour are separate issues – Morrissey’s political opinion becomes irrelevant. Whatever inanities he may postulate, we cannot overlook the fact that he has written a vast and extraordinary catalogue, which has enhanced the lives of his many fans beyond recognition. This is no small thing. He has created original and distinctive works of unparalleled beauty, that will long outlast his offending political alliances.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">At my recent &#8216;In Conversation&#8217; event in Nottingham a gentleman put forward an excellent challenge to my views on free speech &#8211; he pointed out the perceived</span> <span lang="EN-US">racism of Morrissey’s political stance and told how personally wounded he felt by Morrissey’s views on immigration. As I sat in my dressing room after the show, I wished I had done a better job of answering his question &#8211; I felt I had made a poorly constructed, over-earnest and possibly insensitive defence of Morrissey’s right to his opinions, <em>no matter what they are</em>.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">I very much appreciate people challenging my views. The ‘In Conversation’ events are fluid in form and very much a work in progress, and they are intended at times to prompt debate. Sometimes certain uncomfortable issues are raised, but a different point of view is always welcome. Often it can serve as a kind of corrective – even an education – and can be extremely helpful to me next time that same subject is broached. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Open debate and conversation are the very structure of civilisation, and in Nottingham it was a privilege to be challenged by this very thoughtful young man. However, even though I was unsatisfied by my own response, I still believe that despite how upsetting Morrissey’s views may be to the marginalised and dispossessed members of society, or anyone else for that matter, he still should have the freedom to express his views, just as others should have the freedom to challenge them – even if just to know in what guise their enemy may appear. The charge that defending a person’s right to their opinions somehow aligns one with their views makes no sense at all and strikes at the heart of the problem itself – that of conflating the concept of free speech with bigotry. This is very dangerous territory indeed.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">As a songwriter and someone who believes songs possess extraordinary healing power, I am saddened by the thought that songs by arguably the greatest lyricist of his generation &#8211; songs like ‘This Charming Man’, ‘Reel Around the Fountain’ and ‘Last Night I Dreamed Somebody Loved Me’ &#8211; are consigned to the moral dustbin by those who feel they have been tainted by his current political posturing. I respect and understand why people respond in this way, but can’t help but feel it is of significant personal loss to them. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Perhaps it is better to simply let Morrissey have his views, challenge them when and wherever possible, but allow his music to live on, bearing in mind we are all conflicted individuals – messy, flawed and prone to lunacies. We should thank God that there are some among us that create works of beauty beyond anything most of us can barely imagine, even as some of those same people fall prey to regressive and dangerous belief systems. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">Love, Nick</span></p>

<h1 class="post-title">The greatest songs, I think, you wrote under influence of drugs. How is it these days?</h1>
<h3>PETI, ZURICH, SWITZERLAND</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Dear Michael and Peti,</p>
<p>Clearly you people have a difference of opinion. Maybe many an hour is spent amongst Bad Seeds fans squaring the merits of a song like <em>The Mercy Seat</em>, that was written during a period of serious and prolonged heroin and amphetamine use, against <em>Jubilee Street</em>, which was written by two drug-free vegetarians, or comparing a ballad like <em>Love Letter</em> (very stoned) with its tragic counterpart, <em>I Need You</em> (very straight). What makes me happy is that there is actually a conversation to be had. In rock ‘n’ roll there almost never is. Sometimes, but mostly never.</p>
<p>But all speculation aside, the value of a song does not rest with the song itself, but rather the feeling it can provoke in the listener. What moves me may not move you. And so it goes. I see the effect the songs have on my audience when we perform them live so know that these value judgements have little intrinsic meaning &#8211; <em>Girl in Amber</em> may have a young fan in floods of tears and another fan stifling yawns and looking at their watch, and a song like <em>Tupelo</em> can tap into a reservoir of nostalgia for an older fan, but to a millennial, say, be just some crazy shit about a guy called Elvis (and who is Elvis anyway?) One man at a recent <em>In Conversations</em> event told me he got married to <em>Rock of Gibraltar</em> (true story), yet a Gibraltarian wrote to me saying that the release of this ‘atrocious song’ was a ‘dark day for Gibraltar’ and that he had suggested lowering the national flag to half-mast. I have people write to me to say <em>Skeleton Tree</em> is the worst record the Bad Seeds ever made, and I have also read letters from people who value that record beyond all others.</p>
<p>In the end, all I can do as a songwriter is to follow my own heart. I have written most days of my adult life, some of them stoned and some of them straight, and the most I have been able to do was to give the process itself my best shot. The actual value of the songs is weighed entirely in the hearts of those who choose to receive them.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

<h1 class="post-title">How do you forgive yourself for the horrible things you did to someone else in the throes of addiction?</h1>
<h3>MATT, MONTREAL, CANADA</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Ray and Matt,</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">As chance would have it I was clearing some papers off my desk yesterday and found these words,</span> <span lang="EN-US">which I think I wrote a couple of years ago but sort of forgot about. The lyric is called ‘<em>Kiss of the Spider Woman’ </em>and is actually pretty good. As a rock ‘n’ roll lyric it is more fit for purpose than ‘</span><em><span lang="IT">Incinerator Man</span></em><em><span lang="EN-US">’ </span></em><span lang="EN-US">(from #43) –</span> <span lang="EN-US">which, to be honest, reads more like a conventional poem –</span> <span lang="EN-US">so it’s probably easier to arrange these words to music. Ray, you can have it, if you like. If you record and release it, and it becomes a hit and you go on to become a world-famous pop star, well, I’ll be happy. I’ll also be very surprised as the song is about heroin addiction.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">The lyric recalls a time, back in the eighties, when I was stranded in what had to be the worst ‘hotel’ in Tijuana (possibly in the world), withdrawing from a particularly nasty heroin habit. There was a girl involved, of course, and she was Mexican and beautiful and had a tattoo of a spider’s web on her elbow. We’d run out of money and I was strung-out and everything was suitably sordid. We were like a couple of ruined characters from some dreadful Bukowski novel, and if you think it sounds sort of romantic – it wasn’t. I mostly</span> <span lang="EN-US">remember lying in my underwear on the ‘bed’ in a pool of sweat, watching insects drop from the ceiling and crawl around on my chest and not having the strength of purpose to do anything about it. I don’t usually dredge up old memories and put them in songs – it’s bad form, in my opinion, it feels like a sort of betrayal of <em>the now</em> &#8211; so this is why the song probably never saw the light of day. Having said that, it is a solid rock ‘n’ roll lyric and maybe you can do something with it. I don’t want it.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><strong><em><span lang="EN-US">KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">I awake to a voice calling from the other side of the wall</span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">I am alone and tangled in a web of backward thought </span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US"> </span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">The Mexican girl with the luminous skin</span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">Sponged my face that had fallen on the dosshouse floor</span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US"> </span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">The Mexican girl with the web on her elbow </span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">Had eyes like windows and legs like a door</span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US"> </span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">I lay there three days dying, three days or maybe more</span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">We couldn’t close the windows and we sure couldn’t open the door</span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US"> </span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">I love women, but I always loved drugs more</span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">Even when I was in ‘em, I was halfway out the door to score</span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US"> </span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">I kissed the Spider Woman and she spun me deep inside her silk</span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">Hung me from the door frame, rubbed me in argan oil and milk</span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US"> </span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">How many blue skies were lost there, how many missed opportunities?</span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">How many knocked doors unanswered, how many phones left to ring?</span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US"> </span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">How many days lived in the centre of the web, alone and scared?</span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">How often did I call along the threads, only to find nobody there?</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">I am alone and tangled in a web of backward thought</span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">I am the voice calling from the other side of the wall</span></em></p>
<div></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">***</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">So, not a bad lyric, with an elegant shift from the description of memory as a ‘web of tangled thought’, to the ‘web on her elbow’, to the idea of the Spider Woman being the addiction itself, and being ‘spun deep inside her silk’ – lovely metaphor for being stoned, if I may say so myself – followed by the melancholy idea, which every long-term addict will recognise, of ‘calling along the threads to find nobody there’. It then returns full circle to the sticky lacework of recollection. The song is, in itself, a web. This is good stuff, and if you placed the lyrics over a linear two-chord</span> <span lang="EN-US">groove, like ‘Born in the USA’, or ‘Jane Says’ by Jane’s Addiction, or ‘Achy Breaky Heart’ or something like that, well, you never know, you may have a monster hit on your hands! Then again you mightn’t. In this game, you never do know.  </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">If you are going to use these words, I might just draw your attention to the lovely couplet that divides the lyric into its two parts –</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">I love women, but I always loved drugs more</span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><em><span lang="EN-US">Even when I was in ‘em, I was halfway out the door to score</span></em></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">This is in no way a glorification of drug taking, rather these words are heavy with a very real regret for the utter havoc my heroin addiction caused in my relationships with women. Every addict, male or female, will identify with these two lines. However, despite the thread of despair that runs through them, there is much fun to be had in the words themselves and I am especially proud of rhyming ‘<em>women</em>’ with ‘<em>in ‘em’ </em>and the momentum of the internal trip-rhyme ‘</span><em><span lang="NL">door</span></em><em><span lang="EN-US">’ </span></em><span lang="EN-US">with <em>‘score’, </em>as if the narrator of the song is already making a run for it. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">And, Matt, just to say, all addicts at times do horrible things, because addicts are people and people at times do horrible things. The real difficulty that arises around self-forgiveness is when you come to realise that you still do horrible things even when you are clean. My advice to you is this &#8211; <em>be kind</em> &#8211; to yourself and to others. It is the simplest of remedies but remarkably effective. A small, bright act of kindness towards another human being is not only a gesture of existential hope, it also reconciles us with the world, and ultimately becomes the path to self-forgiveness. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="NL">Love, Nick</span></p>

		<title>Nick Cave - The Red Hand Files - Issue #45 - Dear Nick, I was at your In Conversation event in Antwerp. There was a man with a light and a microphone, but suddenly he was gone. I just wanted to tell you something. I didn&#039;t want to tell you and all the other people the full story that evening, just a bit, but I want to tell it to you now. My partner died in 2014: traffic. At that moment I was actually pregnant by him, but nobody knew. It was still a little early and I was pregnant after fertility-treatment. He died and five days after his death, I lost his child. Our child. He was a huge fan of your music and I think I became a fan of your music because of him. &#039;Into My Arms&#039; became our song. The song was playing and he asked me to dance and so it became our song. Nothing special, but for us it was a special song. I wanted to play it at his funeral. People asked me afterwards if I thought it was a love song or a song of loss. A song of love, I thought. It was a silly question - but the man I love was there in a coffin and I just wanted to hear that song on the day he was buried, because it was our song, the song of our love for each other and I loved that man and I still love him. Nothing more, nothing less, that was the reason I wanted it played at his funeral. We had already bought tickets for a Bad Seeds concert together. He was dead, so because of that my best friend went with me. You played &#039;Into My Arms&#039; and I started to cry, not because of the sadness, but because of the beauty of it. I was standing there and for the first time since he passed away, I felt my partner standing by my side. Maybe it sounds stupid, but I really felt him standing by my side. My best friend cuddled me and gave me a kiss on my forehead. She cuddled me in a strong way. I was really crying, smiling too and I felt love everywhere, for and from my partner and for and from my best friend too. I went into a kind of trance of love, it was an amazing experience, that&#039;s for sure, and it was when you were playing that song. I&#039;m crying now, because I feel that same feeling. I still think it was wonderful. It was 2015, those days. My best friend died in 2016: cancer. &#039;Into My Arms&#039; is not just the song for me and my partner anymore, it is the song for and from my best friend and all the people I love, but those two people are standing for true love for me too, so it became a song of true love, true love I actually feel when you play that song. Since they died, I like to be at any of your concerts, because of the amazing beauty I feel when you play &#039;Into My Arms&#039;. I feel Guido and Amber beside me. And all I wanted to ask was if you would play that song, so I could feel them again beside me that evening. The man with the light and the microphone was suddenly gone, but you played &#039;Into My Arms&#039; anyway. I was very grateful that you played it. Now I just want to say &quot;thanks&quot;, for that song, for all of your songs, for such a wonderful evening, because it was with love. : The Red Hand Files</title>

My best friend cuddled me and gave me a kiss on my forehead. She cuddled me in a strong way. I was really crying, smiling too and I felt love everywhere, for and from my partner and for and from my best friend too. I went into a kind of trance of love, it was an amazing experience, that&#8217;s for sure, and it was when you were playing that song.  <br><br>I&#8217;m crying now, because I feel that same feeling. I still think it was wonderful. It was 2015, those days. My best friend died in 2016: cancer. &#8216;Into My Arms&#8217; is not just the song for me and my partner anymore, it is the song for and from my best friend and all the people I love, but those two people are standing for true love for me too, so it became a song of true love, true love I actually feel when you play that song. Since they died, I like to be at any of your concerts, because of the amazing beauty I feel when you play &#8216;Into My Arms&#8217;. I feel Guido and Amber beside me. And all I wanted to ask was if you would play that song, so I could feel them again beside me that evening.  <br><br>The man with the light and the microphone was suddenly gone, but you played &#8216;Into My Arms&#8217; anyway. I was very grateful that you played it. Now I just want to say &#8220;thanks&#8221;, for that song, for all of your songs, for such a wonderful evening, because it was with love.</P>				</h1>

													<a href="https://www.theredhandfiles.com/into-my-arms-love/" title="Dear Nick, I was at your In Conversation event in Antwerp. There was a man with a light and a microphone, but suddenly he was gone. I just wanted to tell you something. I didn&#8217;t want to tell you and all the other people the full story that evening, just a bit, but I want to tell it to you now.  My partner died in 2014: traffic. At that moment I was actually pregnant by him, but nobody knew. It was still a little early and I was pregnant after fertility-treatment. He died and five days after his death, I lost his child. Our child. He was a huge fan of your music and I think I became a fan of your music because of him.  &#8216;Into My Arms&#8217; became our song. The song was playing and he asked me to dance and so it became our song. Nothing special, but for us it was a special song. I wanted to play it at his funeral. People asked me afterwards if I thought it was a love song or a song of loss. A song of love, I thought. It was a silly question &#8211; but the man I love was there in a coffin and I just wanted to hear that song on the day he was buried, because it was our song, the song of our love for each other and I loved that man and I still love him. Nothing more, nothing less, that was the reason I wanted it played at his funeral.  We had already bought tickets for a Bad Seeds concert together. He was dead, so because of that my best friend went with me. You played &#8216;Into My Arms&#8217; and I started to cry, not because of the sadness, but because of the beauty of it. I was standing there and for the first time since he passed away, I felt my partner standing by my side. Maybe it sounds stupid, but I really felt him standing by my side. My best friend cuddled me and gave me a kiss on my forehead. She cuddled me in a strong way.

I want to be like you when I grow up. I guess my question is, what would you say to as not-man, not-woman, pseudo-dyke fan and their unformed yearning to feel right in their body and now has an admittedly unattainable model for exactly what they want to be?",

					<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Mary “Mickey”,</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">I enjoyed your letter very much and I think I understand your notion of &#8220;unformed yearning&#8221; – a kind of longing that has yet to find its provenance. I have felt something similar for most of my life, although obviously in a very different way, and it has taken me a lifetime to work out <em>who I am,</em> or at least what my own personal value is in the world. It also seems that for most of my life I felt a strange gravitational pull toward an undisclosed traumatic event, that could only be described as a <em>dreadful</em> <em>yearning</em>, and I found it eventually in my son’s death – something that both destroyed me and ultimately defined me. It feels that the unformed yearning that followed me through my days, manifested in the death of my son. Does that make any sense to you? My son’s death brought me to the essence of my <em>formed</em> self. I mention this, because it could be that the unformed yearning that you speak of may turn out to be something that eventually obliterates you, but also brings you back to life, transforming you into something beyond yourself. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">As for the &#8220;androgyny and cross-genderedness&#8221; that you spoke of in your letter, well, this can be fairly simply explained. Although I am a man –</span> <span lang="EN-US">and have spent a fair amount of energy writing about that –</span> <span lang="EN-US">I have actually never felt any real allegiance to my masculinity; </span><span lang="EN-US">there was nothing</span><span lang="EN-US"> particularly invested in it, and even </span><span lang="EN-US">though I was more</span><span lang="EN-US"> or less heterosexual, I have always felt pliant in my navigations between maleness and femaleness, even – and perhaps especially – growing up within the overtly masculine Australian culture. It just wasn’t of any special focus to me – my interests were elsewhere – art, music, image, clothes, etc. – of which many of the students at the school I attended, back in the 70s, were deeply suspicious. My small group of friends and I were known at the school as the &#8220;art poofs&#8221; – we kind of liked it actually, and happily appropriated a certain queer and rarefied air, as it ring-fenced us off from the rest of the school, and in retrospect it toughened us up for the world to come. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">I am happy that </span><span lang="EN-US">your girlfriend acknowledged</span><span lang="EN-US"> my &#8220;drag-queen energy&#8221; – which means to me, </span><span lang="FR">defiant</span><span lang="EN-US">, courageous and savvy; to </span><span lang="IT">quote Camille Paglia, </span><span lang="EN-US">“The drag queens of old knew how to handle themselves on the street.” As for me being a role model, well, you could probably do better, but I am honoured to serve as a placeholder until someone more suitable comes along.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">As I said, I very much enjoyed your letter, and maybe I recognise some of what you are talking about. Obviously, I have no real authority to answer you, except to say, I hope you find some form of escape from your “shitty little town”, within yourself or outside of the town itself, and the unformed yearning of which you so beautifully speak, in time, manifests to your needs. Whatever, I am with you.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">With love, Nick</span></p>

					<p>Dear David,</p>
<p>Sure, here are some lyrics for you. They are a little on the dark side and pretty obscure, and perhaps a bit too heavy on the old Frederick Seidel (I had just been reading his brilliant collection of poems, <em>Peaches Goes It Alone</em>), and maybe there is an unearned and spurious use of Holocaust imagery (I apologise for that), and there is not a hell of lot of <em>structure</em> to it, plus the last verse may need a bit of work &#8211; but all that aside, there is some nice symbolism in there and if you chuck on a simple chorus, like <em>“Wo! I’m the Incinerator Man!”</em> and throw it on a lean circular chord formation, with lots of space and air, so that you can really creep the vocal and tell the story, then brother, you may be able to make something worthwhile out of it. I couldn’t.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>INCINERATOR MAN</strong></p>
<p>The moon holds itself in the dark with its glow</p>
<p>The monster moves through the garden</p>
<p>And waits beneath the window</p>
<p>I take the monster for a walk and plough on into town</p>
<p>My monster has a chimney sticking out of its back</p>
<p>I try to find a single story I can bring home</p>
<p>That won’t give you a flat-out heart attack</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be honest I’m not allowed back in the house</p>
<p>It’s Bethlehem there with its cribs and moping beasts</p>
<p>I’m either underneath the school desk braced</p>
<p>Or commuting between Auschwitz and outer space</p>
<p>I’m thinking of drinking something truly horrible</p>
<p>I’m a slow moving monster with a giant chimney</p>
<p>Sticking out of my back. Look out!</p>
<p>I’m coming now just like I came before!</p>
<p>I’m all over the place. I’m the same but more.</p>
<p>There never ever was any turning back</p>
<p>I’m coming now! I’m a full on heart attack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 class="post-title" style="text-align: center;">***</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This, of course, will not help with your &#8220;block&#8221;. My advice to you is to change your basic relationship to songwriting. You are not the ‘Great Creator’ of your songs, you are simply their servant, and the songs will come to you when you have adequately prepared yourself to receive them. They are not inside you, unable to get out; rather, they are outside of you, unable to get in. Songs, in my experience, are attracted to an open, playful and motivated mind. Throw my song away &#8211; it isn’t that good anyway &#8211; sit down, prepare yourself and write your own damn song. You are a songwriter. You have the entire world to save and very little time to do it. The song will find its way to you. If you don’t write it, someone else will. Is that what you want? If not, get to it.</p>
<p>Much love, Nick</p>

<h1 class="post-title">Not sure if there is a whole lot of sex in your religion or a whole lot of religion in your sex. Which is it?</h1>
<h3>KIARA, LONDON, UK</h3>
</div>
<div>
Dear Philip and Kiara,</p>
<p>Philip, please forgive me for the radical edit I made to your question. It went to a place I was not entirely sure I understood &#8211; the gist of which was, I think, that you are a young man who abstains from sex as it allows you to be more “enacted in your existence”, and provides your youthful mind with a heightened sensibility towards your own writing. If I have got that wrong, please excuse me, as I am old, doddery and enfeebled, and certain concepts are simply beyond me.</p>
<p>If I do have the basic premise of your question correct, then I am happy to impart that sexual desire for the aged, as far as I can tell, is not subject to any particularly dramatic downturn, and the reptilian male brain remains as deranged and priapic as ever. Actually, I have a terrible feeling that as we blunder into our bleak and bladdery winter years, it may just get a whole lot worse. Of course, it may just be that I am living a kind of last hurrah, and in a year or two a band of tearful mermaids will wave goodbye as I sail my little empty boat into the setting sun, with an oar that won’t row, row, row. I don’t know, but I’ll keep you informed.</p>
<p>With regards to sexual desire and songwriting, creativity and desire have always been inextricably linked for me. Many songs I write are simply erotic re-enactments, written with the sole intention of creating a remembered image of the one I love and, indeed, desire. Beyond that though, there is a certain sexualness to the very act of writing – the process itself is erotic. With songwriting we enter the imagination, that wildest of erogenous zones, where intense, obsessive yearning can be like a roaring in the heart and the loins both. The imagination becomes both the ‘safe space’ and the ‘un-safe space’, a strange blend of almost religious rigour and total abandonment, where everything rises to the starry heavens, even as it goes to hell.</p>
<p>So to answer your question, Philip, the good news is that this imaginative space still feels alive with potential  – old age has not diminished it  – indeed, it still rages and burns.</p>
<p>And, Kiara, to get to your question, I think this is why religion and the erotic are often indistinguishable from each other in my writing &#8211; they both inhabit the same yearning space, are both transcendent acts of wishfulness, and both require the imagination to make them function in any meaningful way. You are right to suggest that there may not be any difference between them at all.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

		<title>Nick Cave - The Red Hand Files - Issue 41 - Dear Nick, a couple of years ago I found myself in the midst of a heated debate about how each of us imagined God&#039;s voice. At least a couple of people said that God would sound like you. Not me. There is a twistedness to my idea of God that makes me think of Tom Waits. In your mind, does God have a voice and if so, is it a familiar one? Or does God make him/her/itself heard in other ways? : The Red Hand Files</title>

					<p>Dear Rute,</p>
<p>I hope the voice of God would be something other than booming, authoritarian and male. Wouldn’t that be a pleasant surprise? How nice it would be if God’s voice didn’t sound like Nick Cave or Tom Waits – or Morgan Freeman for that matter. What a relief that would be.</p>
<p>In the recording studio, when you multi-layer vocals, sometimes the more voices you lay down and the more varied they are, the more pure the tone of the chorus becomes, as all individuality is erased and a pristine collected sound flows forth. As you add more voices, a strange inverse reaction happens, and the smaller, more distilled and weirdly intimate the cascade of voices seems to become. Perhaps that is what God sounds like. Perhaps, God would have the combined voice of all the untold billions of collected souls, an assembly of the departed speaking as one – without rancour, domination or division; a great, many-layered calling forth that rings from the heavens in the small, determined voice of a child, maybe; sexless, pure and uncomplicated – that says <em>&#8216;Look for me. I am here&#8217;</em>.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

					<p>Dear Freyja,</p>
<p>Yes, I can certainly help you with this problem but it will involve a bit of witchcraft I’m afraid, and you must follow my instructions, closely.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Find a quiet place where you will not be disturbed and sit down and close your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Bring to mind your &#8220;terrible relationship&#8221; in all its fucked-upness and, despite how painful this may be, spend a couple of minutes allowing this memory to permeate your mind.</p>
<p><strong>3) </strong>Imagine a shimmering golden cord that attaches you to the memory of this relationship. Really imagine it.</p>
<p><strong>4) </strong>In your mind, speak down the cord to the other person in the relationship, and despite what a douche-bag this person may have been, wish them well. Say &#8211;</p>
<p><strong>May you be happy on your journey wherever it may lead.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5)</strong> Now, imagine a giant pair of scissors cutting the golden cord in half and that &#8220;terrible relationship&#8221; floating off into space, never to bother you again.</p>
<p><strong>6)</strong> You are now released spiritually from this relationship. Breathe in this freedom and remember these words, from me to you &#8211;</p>
<p><strong>I am returning my songs to you, unharmed. May they remain with you forever.</strong></p>
<p><strong>7)</strong> Now, go to your record player or laptop or whatever and play a Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds song and say &#8211;</p>
<p><strong>I reclaim this song. This song is mine.</strong></p>
<p>You have now reasserted ownership of these songs. They belong with you. May they travel lightly with you through the years, for they are forever yours.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

Dear Samuel, Elena, Lars, Florian, Mel and Liii,</p>
<p>It was about eight months after our son had died. Susie and I had barely left the house. Susie decided it would be a good idea if we went somewhere for a few days to just get away from it all. Often times you think a change in location might put things right, but, of course, in the end, you take yourself with you and the thing you are running from ultimately finds you. So it was with us. We flew to Marrakesh and checked into a hotel next to the central square.</p>
<p>That evening, Susie and I walked through the main market place of Marrakesh. It is difficult to exaggerate the suffering of the animals that we saw there – ancient donkeys and workhorses being flogged, monkeys on chains, dozens of chickens stuffed into small cages, emaciated street dogs, skinned carcasses hanging on hooks. Death and suffering and cruelty were everywhere and I felt overwhelmed by a dark energy. How much of this energy existed within Marrakesh itself or how much I was carrying with me was difficult to say, but everywhere I looked I saw existential anguish. I was, in part, seeing this remarkable city through my own cultural prejudices, of course, and it was not lost on me that industrial farming in the West, in terms of net suffering, was on a vastly greater scale than what I was witnessing here on the streets of Marrakesh. However, it was the seeing, the close proximity to the cruelty, that made all the difference.</p>
<p>Susie had met a man on the plane, an English guy, who had set up a rescue centre for ancient workhorses in Marrakesh and Susie wanted to visit it, so the next day we caught a cab and drove there.</p>
<p>On the way to the rescue centre, we entered a busy roundabout and saw, in the middle of the road, a cat that had been run over. Its back was broken and it was arched horribly, spraying blood and literally screaming in pain. It was a deeply upsetting sight and one that instantly attached itself to the most vulnerable and traumatic images that lived in my mind. At that moment, something ruptured. I had had enough. Life was too much. It was literally impossible to bear. My son was gone. I would never see him again. In the back of the cab, in Marrakesh, I broke down.</p>
<p>The next morning, we decided to return to the UK. But, sitting on the plane, something had changed in me. I felt different. I felt that if I were to continue to live in this world I had to do what I could to reduce the existential suffering around me, or at the very least, not to add to it. It felt like a way forward. I felt that our collective unhappiness was brimming at its maximum capacity. There was no room for any more. I felt a sense of duty to do whatever I could, in my own way, to minimise sentient suffering. That call to action extended in many directions, and has stayed with me since, but one of the consequences of it was that I gave up eating meat. I have not eaten it since.</p>
<h1 class="post-title" style="text-align: center;">***</h1>
<p>As we go through our lives we take on the expanding burden of our own distress – as we are abandoned, broken apart, betrayed, isolated, lost and hurt. This is essentially part of what it is to live. This despair will overwhelm us and turn inward into bitterness, resentment and hatred &#8211; worse, we will take it out upon the ones closest to us if we do not actively live our lives in the service of others and use what power we have to reduce each other’s suffering. This, in my opinion, is essentially the key to living. This is the remedy to our own suffering; our own feelings of separateness and of disconnectedness. And it is the essential antidote for loneliness.</p>
<p>We must live our lives in such a way as to make better, even in the smallest way, the situation that we are currently experiencing. This is what it means to ‘take on the suffering of the world’ – that we each act in accordance with the limits of our own personal capacity for good. By doing this, the lives around us will become incrementally better and therefore, so will our own lives, and the life of the world itself.</p>
<p>In the Philip Larkin poem ‘The Mower’, Larkin runs over a hedgehog while he is mowing the lawn. As he removes the body of the hedgehog from the blades of the mower, he muses on the nature of death and ends the poem with these words.</p>
<p>We should be careful<br />
Of each other, we should be kind<br />
While there is still time</p>
<p>The urgency of these words came to me on that flight back from Marrakesh. The vision of the dying cat wrenched me from my own self-absorption and bitterness and isolation and loneliness and showed me that the world, in all its terrible wounded beauty, was in need of our urgent attention.</p>
<p>Much love, Nick</p>

<h1 class="post-title">I always liked the line in &#8216;Nature Boy&#8217;, about how beauty is gonna save the world. Is there anything that you think of as essentially beautiful, and that is sustained and forceful enough to save us.</h1>
<h3>DAVID, BERLIN, GERMANY</h3>
</div>
<p>Dear Nick and David,</p>
<p>I very much understand your distress. It is often difficult to look at the world through anything other than an apocalyptic prism and in doing so, simply despair. You wake up in the morning, look out at the day &#8211; blue sky, fluffy clouds – then go online and ten minutes later you have lost the will to live. Sadly, the existential terror we absorb through the constant onslaught of bad news can become the gift we pass onto our children – a terminal anxiety that rings down through the generations and infects everything we do.</p>
<p>In the first verse of the Bad Seeds song &#8216;Nature Boy&#8217;, I recall an incident that happened when I was fourteen years old, at my grandmother’s house in Melbourne. I saw a news report on TV that showed footage of the attempted assassination of American presidential candidate, George Wallace. I remember it occurring to me that this was real and not made-up, like in the movies, and being extremely disturbed by the images. I had simply never seen anything like it. This particular piece of footage has remained lodged in my memory ever since; Wallace’s speech, the walk through the crowd, the armed assassin, the gun going off, Wallace bleeding on the ground. My father, who was watching TV with me, saw my distress and his response was two-fold. He told me that, yes, these terrible things happen but he also set about showing me stuff he thought was beautiful – reading me things mostly, and encouraging me to follow an artistic direction in my life. It was a simple but effective action, a redressing of the balance of the bad and the good, and life changing in its way.</p>
<p>So, I have always seen it as a kind of parental duty to show my own children beautiful stuff, and in doing so reveal to them an alternate world. By beautiful, I mean interesting, inspiring, ambiguous, challenging and sometimes dangerous things that exist within the world of art. I feel that the online world provides us ready access to a vast and ever-deepening barrage of bad shit, where the cruel reality of the world is well covered. This continual onslaught of negativity can erode our souls and the souls of our children. My job is to show my children that there is a whole universe that exists beyond the grim issues of the day. This is not to divert them from certain truths, but rather to remind them that the parallel world of art and the imagination can literally save their lives, as it certainly saved mine.</p>
<p>The good news is that kids react well to this sort of attention. It is nice to imagine that as they go about their business, dealing with the world, they may have a copy of <em>Lolita</em>, similar to that given to me by my father, shoved in their jacket pocket. And as they respond to the world we have built for them, inventing new forms of madness beyond our comprehension (as we did with our own parents), it is comforting to feel they have some understanding of the aesthetic nature of the world and art’s ultimate capacity for salvation.</p>
<p>Love Nick x</p>

<h1 class="post-title">Do you smoke?</h1>
<h3>SUSAN, LOS ANGELES, USA</h3>
</div>
<p>Dear Dee and Susan,</p>
<p>A couple of Bad Seeds tours ago, when I was trying to stop smoking, I limited myself to one cigarette a day. After the show, as soon as I came off stage, Jacek, my assistant, would escort me to a solitary chair in the back alley of the venue, where I would sit and roll a cigarette. With immense anticipation, I would light that little white stick of joy and inhale. There, in the Zen-like supremacy of the moment, on the road and adrift in this world, the nicotine would enter my bloodstream and with a blissful rush of pure meaning God would declare Himself to me &#8211; just as He did to you, Dee, on your balcony, at 21.49, on that rainy evening in Rosario, Argentina. That five minute interlude, puffing on a cigarette, in the deranged chaos of our lives &#8211; you on your balcony and me in some alley in some foreign city &#8211; was, to paraphrase Leonard Cohen, the crack where the light came in. </p>
<p>So, how do I really feel about God? Well, the more absent He feels, and the more indifferent the cosmos appears to be, the more fervent and necessary my search for meaning becomes. For me though, the actual existence of God is beside the point &#8211; the argument between belief and disbelief does nothing to assuage the sadness and emptiness I sometimes feel in the face of existence. Prayer and meditation, however, do help me hugely, even if I am praying to a phantom or a memory or an invention. These acts of devotion, and investment in the unknowable, define my life. Whether God is my witness or whether He is not is not of my concern and has no real impact on the spiritual nature of my life. For me, the search itself is where the action is.</p>
<p>As the Bad Seeds tour progressed I predictably began to seek my communion with God before the show as well, then in the middle of the day, until eventually I was jamming a cigarette in my mouth the moment I woke up, till the moment I went to sleep and I was back to a pack and a half a day &#8211; equally predictably God vanished and all I was left with was the age-old, fiendish cigarette habit, as I coughed and wheezed my way across Europe. After the tour I simply gave up and haven’t had a cigarette since. </p>
<p>Now, I sometimes think I have discovered God in other situations. Sometimes I feel a certain divine presence and sometimes I don’t &#8211; but I still long for meaning and I still search. A fool’s mission maybe, but wherever this journey may lead, please Dee, next time you sit on the balcony with the rain coming down, put on a Bad Seeds record &#8211; something loud or something soft, it doesn’t matter &#8211; and light up a fag for me. I am with you in spirit. </p>
<p>With love, Nick</p>

<h1 class="post-title">I am kinda involved with my third Nick Cave fan. They are all just, er, impossible to resist. Also my friends who are from the same universe say, &#8220;Nick Cave fans are just too kind and special&#8221;. What do you think about your fans?</h1>
<h3>ME, XX, XX</h3>
</div>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Florencia and You,</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">When I stand on stage I feel a tremendous need emanating from the audience. I recognise this need because it exists within myself. I think we all see the opportunity for rapture and recognise its importance. Ultimately, this is a relationship of mutual dependence, that surpasses simple entertainment and moves into the domain of the sacred. I say this because the performative act, for me, is a process of peeling away one</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s ego and self-importance, of letting go and laying oneself open to the audience, in a mutual acknowledgement of each other</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s humanity. In doing so, a simple but profound connection is made. This connection is the responsibility of both the audience and the performer </span>– <span lang="EN-US">we take each other</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s hands and move beyond ourselves to a higher place of spiritual reciprocity in order to restore each other. If we can do this together, we have achieved something sublime. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">I feel that over time my audience and I have come to fully understand this relationship. I think we have brought each other to this heightened place, and we all feel a mutual and urgent call to traverse our individual suffering and just fucking <em>lose</em> ourselves.  </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Perhaps there are some performers who see the performative process as a one-way street, where the artist is dominant and simply delivers, whilst the passive audience receives. Personally, I do not see it in this way, at all. As the writer, Greil Marcus says, the performer needs </span>“<span lang="EN-US">an aggressive, critical audience, with a conscious sense of itself as an audience, </span>…<span lang="EN-US"> one whose complexity and diverse needs can push an artist beyond comfortable limits.</span>” <span lang="EN-US">This is how I experience it. I feel, on stage, that the audience is<em> making</em> me, just as I am <em>making</em> them, in an act of shared, primordial creation. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">As a consequence of this, Florencia, our fans have grown to be uniquely devotional, that is to say, devotional to the transcendent experience itself, just as the Bad Seeds and I are more devotional to the audience and their needs. We are all just completely <em>needed </em></span>and<em><span lang="EN-US"> in need.</span></em></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">And, You, from Xx, whoever you are and wherever you may be, be careful with that third Nick Cave fan you</span>’re <em>kinda</em><span lang="EN-US"> involved with. Be nice. Treasure her or him. They are indeed kind and special people, full of a formidable beauty and may just end up being the very best part of you.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Love to you all, Nick</span></p>

<h1 class="post-title">How do you feel about the current trend of connecting the shortcomings of an artist&#8217;s personal conduct and the art they create and using that criteria to determine if said works are corrupted and therefore to be relegated to the dustbins or not?<br />
What does it mean for the future of art if we expect our artists, those that help us collectively explore and understand the human experience, to be morally perfect and beyond reproach?</h1>
<h3>JASON, BROOKLYN, USA</h3>
</div>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Dylan and Jason,</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Rock music has lurched and shuddered its way through its varied and tumultuous history and somehow managed to survive. It is within the very nature of rock ‘n’ roll to mutate and to transform &#8211; to die so it can live again. </span><span lang="EN-US">This churning is what keeps the whole thing moving forward. As musicians we are always in danger of becoming obsolete and superseded by the next generation’s efforts, or by the world itself and its big ideas. Not so long ago the big idea in the world was freedom of expression. It looks like the new big idea is moralism. Will rock music survive this one? We shall see. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">My feeling is that modern rock music, as we know it, has anyway </span><span lang="EN-US">been </span><span lang="EN-US">ailing for</span><span lang="EN-US"> some time now. It has become afflicted with a kind of tiredness and confusion and faint-heartedness,</span> <span lang="EN-US">and no longer has the stamina to fight the great battles that rock music has always </span><span lang="EN-US">fought. </span><span lang="EN-US">It seems to me there is little new or authentic, </span><span lang="EN-US">as it becomes safer, more nostalgic, more cautious and more corporate.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">As far as rock music goes, I think that the new moral zealotry that is descending upon our culture could actually be a good thing. </span><span lang="EN-US">Maybe</span><span lang="EN-US">,</span><span lang="EN-US"> it</span><span lang="EN-US"> is exactly what rock ‘n’ roll needs at this moment in time. Contemporary rock music no </span><span lang="EN-US">longer </span><span lang="EN-US">seems to have</span><span lang="EN-US"> the fortitude to contend with these enemies of the imagination, these enemies of art &#8211; and in this present form perhaps rock music isn’t worth saving. The permafrost of puritanism could be the antidote for the weariness and nostalgia that grips it. Perhaps a painful reckoning is needed – a great crushing of creativity that descends and lays its self-righteous ice across art –</span> <span lang="EN-US">so that in time, a wild, dangerous and radical form of music can tear its way through the ice, teeth bared, and rock ‘n’ roll can get back to the business of transgression. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Transgression is fundamental to the artistic imagination, because the imagination deals with the forbidden. Go to your record collection and mind-erase those who have led questionable lives and see how much of it remains. It is the artist who steps beyond the accepted social </span><span lang="EN-US">boundaries </span><span lang="EN-US">who will bring back</span><span lang="EN-US"> ideas that shed new light on what it means to be alive. This is, in fact, the artist’s </span><span lang="EN-US">duty </span><span lang="EN-US">&#8211; and sometimes this</span><span lang="EN-US"> journey is accompanied by a certain dissolute behaviour, especially in rock ‘n’ roll. In fact, the nature of rock ‘n’ roll <em>is</em> dissolute. Sometimes an individual’s behaviour is purely malevolent, and </span><span lang="EN-US">this </span><span lang="EN-US">surely needs</span><span lang="EN-US"> to be exposed for what </span><span lang="EN-US">it is &#8211; and we must make a personal choice as to whether or not we engage with their work.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">However, in the world of ideas the sanctimonious have little or</span> <span lang="EN-US">no place. Art must be wrestled from the hands of the pious, in whatever form they may come</span><span lang="EN-US"> &#8211; </span><span lang="EN-US">and they are </span><em><span lang="EN-US">always </span></em><span lang="EN-US">coming, knives out, in</span><span lang="EN-US">tent </span><span lang="EN-US">on murdering creativity.</span> A<span lang="EN-US">t </span><span lang="EN-US">this depressing time in rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll though,</span> <span lang="EN-US">perhaps they can serve a purpose, perhaps rock music needs to die for a while, so that something powerful and subversive and truly monumental can rise up out of it.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">Love, Nick</span></p>

					<p>Dear Georgia,</p>
<p>In early 2000, I saw Johnny Cash walk into a studio in LA, old and ill and temporarily blind (he had toward the end of his life a condition that affected his sight), sit down and sing a song, then transform into a higher being. I have seen Nina Simone climb a flight of stairs to the stage at the Royal Festival Hall in London, barely able to walk, sit down at the piano and be transformed. I have seen Shane MacGowan stand on stage at a concert in France after taking ten LSD trips, and not knowing where he was, shuffle to the microphone, begin to sing so very beautifully, and be transformed. These transformative moments encapsulate the religious nature of performance as they imitate the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ Himself. This narrative of suffering and rebirth is played out again and again within our own lives, but I believe it is captured most beautifully, within the musical performance itself. Through the boundless power of music, a performer transcends his or her own wretchedness by performing a kind of public exorcism and by doing so, transforms into a deity.</p>
<p>In 1981, in London, I saw the movie <em>This Is Elvis</em>. I had always been an Elvis fan, with a special love for the songs he made in the seventies – <em>Suspicious Minds</em>, <em>In the Ghetto</em>, <em>Kentucky Rain</em>, <em>Always on My Mind</em> – and had a particular obsession with the gospel album, <em>How Great Thou Art</em> that he recorded in the early sixties. The last ten minutes of <em>This Is Elvis</em> changed my ideas on performance forever.</p>
<p>In the final minutes of the film, we see Elvis, on stage in Las Vegas, sing the famous so-called ‘Laughing Version’ of <em>Are You Lonesome Tonight?</em> The camera begins with a long shot and does a slow zoom in on Elvis’s face. Elvis is stoned and overweight and by the time he performs the disastrous central monologue, we can see the pure anguish of his performance, the drugged and mortified eyes, the terrible aloneness, the horror of the moment &#8211; his vast soul crucified on the cross of his own body as he blunders through the words. It is one of the most traumatic pieces of footage I have ever seen. This is followed by the medley, <em>An American Trilogy</em>. Elvis dies and as the world media reports his death, we hear him sing <em>Dixie</em> over shots of his funeral procession. We see the motorcade, the weeping crowds, the coffin, and the flowers, as the film returns to the Vegas concert and Elvis sings the eternally beautiful <em>All My Trials</em>. To me it is immeasurably moving, Elvis’s head bowed, his extraordinary voice steeped in sorrow &#8211; then the band rises, he lifts his head and sings <em>The Battle Hymn of the Republic</em> and Elvis is resurrected, triumphant. It is pure religion and as powerful as anything I have ever seen. The final shot of him, in slow motion, arms outstretched, the angel wings of his silver cape flung wide, shows his exultant ascent into heaven.</p>
<p>As I walked from the cinema, I was left with these three images &#8211; Elvis’s mortified, tear-streaked face; his head hung in sorrowful acceptance; and his caped arms outstretched in triumph. These are the stages of Christ’s passage upon the cross, the anguish, the sufferance and the resurrection, a journey which welcomes us all, in time.</p>
<p>Elvis continued performing until the end. In my eyes, he was some kind of angel; both terribly and awfully human yet divine in his meteoric reach that touched so many hearts. He was fallible and God-like at the same time. He crucified himself on stage in Vegas, at the supper show and the late show, hundreds and hundreds of times. His latter years on Earth were as sad and lonely as any can be, but his Vegas performances were epic triumphs of human transcendence, where the angels looked down on one who had fallen so far, then looked up to where he ascended.</p>
<p>Much love, Nick</p>

<h1 class="post-title">Have you ever suffered a crisis of confidence?</h1>

<h1 class="post-title">Do you have a harsh inner critic?</h1>
<h3>SOPHIA, LIVERPOOL, UK</h3>
</div>
<div>
Dear Ursula, Joe, Rod and Sophia and many more,</p>
<p>I don’t know how many times I have been asked this question, or a version of it, in <em>The Red Hand Files</em>. Let me say this &#8211; the ‘harsh inner critic’ that you speak of is in no way unique to you. The truth is that virtually anybody who is trying to do anything worthwhile at all, especially creatively, has seated in his or her brain, a horrible homunculus that blows a dreadful little trumpet, and only knows one song – a song that goes, “You are not good enough. Why bother?” This evil little gnome is full of bad jazz, and is, in the words of author Sam Harris, “an asshole.” The enemy of aspiration, this atrocious inner voice demands you turn away from whatever your higher calling may be and become a second-rate, cut-price version of yourself. As your very own personal detractor it is deeply persuasive in its dark business. Many of us listen, many of us accept its message, and many of us throw up our hands and give in. The problem is, of course, that this inner voice, this monstrous homunculus, is you.</p>
<p>The creative act is an act of war – but as much as this inner critic is your adversary, it is also fundamental to the creative process. It is what anyone worth their salt is doing battle with <em>all the time </em>– we are in a perpetual dogfight with the lesser version of ourselves. To lose the battle is to become the embodiment of the homunculus itself. Defeated, we do nothing but sit in perpetual judgment of the world, idly watching, as it goes down in flames. As vicious as this fight with our own selves may be, it is this very conflict that puts the blood in the art, the tears too, and carves the battle scars deep into the work itself.</p>
<p>The world, for all its failings, is an extraordinary experiment in rampant human imagination. At its best, it exists because there were people who had the courage to follow through on an idea – who resisted the inner voice that said, “You are worthless. Why bother?”</p>
<p>I’ve said it before. Beautiful ideas abound. These ideas swim around us, ideas that can be of immense utility to world. Some ideas have our singular names inscribed upon them and it is our responsibility to reach beyond our lesser selves to the brightest version of what we can be and breathe life into these ideas. This act of reaching is almost always accompanied by the wretched homunculus and its dreary anthem of personal incompetence, but it is our sacred duty, to turn around and kick this little fucker in the balls. The fight with the dark force inside us is the forge in which true art is formed.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>
<p>P.S.  A homunculus is a very small human or humanoid creature.</p></div>

<p>It’s the early hours of the morning, here in Los Angeles, and I can’t sleep. I’ve been in the studio all night, working on new songs. The melodies and words are running around in my head, so excuse this letter if it’s kind of scrambled. You asked about love, Mack, and maybe that’s what love is right there &#8211; maybe <em>songs </em>are the parlance of love. Maybe that’s what we have conceived them for – to give a voice to this strange, inscrutable feeling that tears away at us, all our lives. I don’t know. Maybe some songs are the embodiment of love itself and that’s why they move us so deeply. They are simple, plainspoken, incendiary devices that bomb the heart to pieces – something other art forms can’t do with the same sudden and frightening precision.</p>
<p>So, here is a list of ten of my most treasured love songs – old, sad songs mostly, and sentimental too, that have travelled with me through the years, holding sway over my world and never failing to rescue me. They are just small unassuming love bombs, but dear Luiza, as important as anything can ever be.</p>
<p>Much love, Nick<br />

					<p>Dear Jo,</p>
<p>Our dear friend Dominique Issermann was photographing Susie, at our home in Brighton, for a fashion magazine. I was the designated assistant for the day and when I poked my head in the room to see if anyone wanted a cup of tea, Dominique asked me to go to the bedroom window and open the shutters to let the sunlight in. Susie was changing for the next shot and was naked under her robe and in a purely improvised act of subversion dropped the robe as I opened the shutters. Dominique, the most fast-thinking and attentive photographer I have ever met, snapped the picture &#8211; one photograph and that was it. We were not attempting to shoot an album cover, rather this was a moment snatched from time, which we promptly forgot about.</p>
<p>The next day, as Susie and I sat with Dominique looking through the shots, we found this remarkable photograph. It instantly spoke to us, reminding me of Masaccio’s fresco, Expulsion from the Garden of Eden, a much-loved Old Testament story of mine, and I thought it would make a great cover for <em>Push the Sky Away</em>, as it felt in keeping with many of the record’s concerns. I showed it to the band and they seemed happy and everyone in my office loved it. So that was that, the Dominique Issermann picture became the cover.</p>
<p>How lovely the cover is and how beautiful my wife looks &#8211; the animal stance, up on her toes, the defensive positioning of her arms, and her face hidden in her hair. It is a brave and unsettling picture pulsing with ambiguity, mythology and life, and is probably Susie’s most treasured shot of herself and a favourite of Dominique’s as well.</p>
<p>When the record came out there was a flurry of disapproval from a handful of people that questioned why Susie was naked and I wasn’t, that it was exploitative and sexist, inferring that I had somehow forced Susie into taking the picture. I was flattered that there were people who thought I had Svengali-like powers over my wife, and could cast spells on her and do with her as I pleased, but sadly this is not the case. I would say, in fact, that the situation is completely the reverse.</p>
<p>I understand why people may have found the cover disturbing, but in the end, beauty knows best &#8211; it leads us beyond our narrow notions of what is appropriate into the realms of the enigmatic and discomforting. Here, beauty creates a dissonance in the mind that inflames the imagination. This fire of the mind is the place where the angels and devils play happily together. I hope this is also the place where many of my songs reside.</p>
<p>Dominique’s photo is an uncanny and haunting work, born of a happy accident and full of contradictions, that will be forever attached to <em>Push the Sky Away</em> and of which Susie and I are immensely proud.</p>
<p>Much love, Nick</p>

					<p>Dear Vivian,</p>
<p>Susie is sitting across the kitchen table from me, humming to herself and knitting what looks like a scarf. I have just read her your very sweet message. She is confused to find that Denmark has now become part of Australia, but Google tells us that Denmark is a small coastal town in Western Australia with a population of 2,558 people. Susie says she wants to go there on holiday and hug you back.</p>
<p>In <em>One More Time With Feeling</em> we see an interview with a woman who is new in her grief. I don’t think I could ever watch that piece of footage of Susie again. It was the very hardest part &#8211; to see, day by day, the uncontainable and merciless dimensions of grief. It is the very reason I am so careful when I reply on <em>The Red Hand Files</em> to people who have lost someone, because I have seen the tenuous hold that a grieving mother has on life itself. I have seen the paralysis and the terrible retreat from the world. I have seen life lived in a darkened room, essentially a tomb, crumpled around a memory, as if to be dead herself somehow brought her closer to the spirit of her departed child. I learned the appalling meaning of the words ‘inconsolable’ and ‘helpless’ &#8211; and I never knew a person could cry for so long.</p>
<p>But I have also seen a woman ultimately step from that room, changed – defiant and scoured clean by grief; a woman with a mutinous and ferocious grace, now more open, daring and creative than ever; a woman who has simply defied the cosmic odds and bloomed.</p>
<p>And I think that is what Susie and I want to say to those deep in grief, to the inconsolable. We want to say that, in spite of ourselves, life moves on. That in time we learn to absorb our loss, as a form of armouring, and that it can become our strength. That the very thing we thought would destroy us, now becomes a fierce source of creative power, as if our departed are breathing an essential energy through us, drawn from a wellspring deep within the trauma itself. We want to say that allowing this process of renewal to occur is the greatest gift we can give to those who have left us. We become the living vessels that carry their spirits, out of that dark and shuttered place, and release them into the heavens.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to say that even though there are still the deep and sudden weeps &#8211; the flash floods &#8211; they don’t assert the same hold on us anymore, for we know they pass, as do all things.</p>
<p>So, Vivian, to answer your question, &#8220;how is Susie doing?&#8221; Susie is doing okay. I watch her now, across from me, humming to herself and knitting a scarf and I am awed.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

<h1 class="post-title">In what way did the profession of your father influence you as an artist and as a person?</h1>
<h3>MICHAEL, SEVENOAKS, ENGLAND</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 class="post-title">Do you believe in an afterlife? If not, what do you think happens when we die?</h1>
<h3>THEO, BRIGHTON, ENGLAND</h3>
</div>
<p>Dear Catherine, Michael and Theo,</p>
<p>I am not sure what my ‘earliest’ memory was – rather I have a muddle of images from my childhood, that make no real sense to me at all. I remember seeing a decapitated chicken running around a chopping block; I remember my mother naming the flowers in our garden; I remember climbing up a wire fence, falling off and splitting open my head; I remember my father painting a theatre prop in the backyard; I remember the devastating feeling of letting go of my mother’s hand on the first day of kindergarten – these memories are part of a disjointed narrative that lives inside my head and that approximates my childhood. But mostly I just remember the feeling of my childhood – that it was free, uncomplicated and happy and that my parents loved me. I have one memory however that sits firmly in my mind because it was the same episode that played out over many nights.</p>
<p>My father was involved in amateur theatre and this meant that some nights he was away from home. At some point he explained to me that he was performing in the play Oedipus. To my child’s mind that involved him dressing up in a cat outfit – as in Oedi-puss. Many nights I would lie awake in bed, waiting for my father to come home, and in the silent darkness, if I concentrated hard enough, I could hear my blood beating in my ears. I would imagine this sound was my father’s footsteps coming down the garden path. I imagined him in his cat suit arriving home and the rhythm of his steps comforted me and I would fall asleep.</p>
<p>Does this memory speak to any thematic concerns? I don’t know. Probably. But I will say this. My father instilled in me the idea of the pre-eminence of creativity – that to create was an act of largesse that had the capacity to redeem the world, and that the pursuit of this path was a serious matter. My father despised cynicism. He felt that whatever a person decided to do in life, they needed to apply themselves fully to the task, and not fuck around. Admittedly, I took a fairly destructive and treacherous route on the way to understanding what he meant. But I know now. He meant that we are at war with the mundane and the uninspired, and that apathy and complacency are moral failings and that it is our urgent duty to be of service to the world. He meant that what we do in life has consequences, and that each of us are effectual and of great value. He believed in the sovereignty of the individual and felt that although we do not always have control over the things that happen to us, it is entirely our choice how we live our life in relation to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">* * * *</p>
<p>Sometimes, Theo, I think, that if there is an after-life, it will have something to do with the worlds we have dreamed or imagined, especially as children. I think these luminous imaginings, these memories, are locked deep into our sub-conscious and that the infinite and enigmatic nature of consciousness and the possibility of an after-life are inextricably linked. At times, I think that when I die and my spirit leaves my body, searching for its guide, it will be met by a glimmering man in a cat suit walking down the garden path toward me.</p>
<p>Love Nick</p>

					<p class="BodyA" dir="ltr"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Katja,</span></p>
<p class="BodyA" dir="ltr"><span lang="EN-US">These days the word ‘</span><span lang="ES-TRAD">evil</span><span lang="EN-US">’ is seen by many as anachronistic and outmoded. What much contemporary thought offers us is a representation of humanity as little more than a mass of twitching nerves, with no inherent purpose other than to merely exist, that there is no ultimate good or bad, and concepts such as evil are redundant social constructs. I disagree, of course, and I must answer your question through my own view of the world &#8211; that we are spiritual and transcendent beings, that our lives have meaning, and that our individual actions have vast implications on the well-being of the universe. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA" dir="ltr"><span lang="EN-US">Throwing tobacco in the eyes of an animal in a zoo is an act of deliberate malevolence, and in that respect, evil. However, I think we must all look inside ourselves and acknowledge that we each have a capacity for malevolence. It requires little self-examination to envisage a situation where ‘good’ people could &#8211; under certain circumstances &#8211; perform acts that are wicked. This acknowledgement of our own capacity for evil, difficult as it may be, can ultimately become our redemption. If we don’t acknowledge our potential for malevolence, we disconnect ourselves from the unlimited ability for good that is contained within us. It is important to understand that as individual human beings we hold, in our own hands, the ability to both destroy and save the world. </span></p>
<p class="BodyA"><span lang="EN-US">The transcendent spirit for good can be accessed with profound effect through the imagination &#8211; the creative force can act as a counter-agent to evil. We cannot eradicate evil, yet it need not paralyse us &#8211; rather we </span><span lang="EN-US">should take</span><span lang="EN-US"> what steps we can, however small, toward the betterment of the world, and our place in it.</span> <span lang="EN-US">This is the essence of creativity.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA" dir="ltr"><span lang="EN-US">Sometimes, the world appears to lean deeper into its evilness and feels reductive and devoid of light, but Katja, your letter of concern is a small and subversive act of goodwill that can help tilt the world the other way. You are never helpless in the face of evil (unless you sit in perpetual condemnation of the world, as some sadly do). Your simple act of solicitude is the spark of kindness that can illuminate the entire universe. The world already feels brighter.</span></p>
<p class="BodyA" dir="ltr"><span lang="NL">Love, Nick</span></p>

					<p>Dear Sarah,</p>
<p>The truth is it is very difficult to be sad on stage. When I walk on stage, I am thrust into the immediate moment &#8211; into the acute and astonishing now. I am seized by the enormous energy of the crowd, and the power of the music itself, where all memories disappear and the future does not exist. I am simply situated in the ecstatic present. I sing the songs with the utmost attention. I attempt to carry my audience with me, into the fullness of the moment, by applying complete concentration to the words. The words deliver their meaning, speaking to me afresh, <em>as if for the first time</em>, because the present moment is perpetually the first time. It is a state of blamelessness – a rapturous innocence – freed from what has gone before and what is yet to come.</p>
<p>However, every now and then, a sudden thought, beyond my control, pierces this state of present-ness – a devastating image or a shocking recollection or an impossible wish – and that <em>holy state of now</em> ruptures and the world comes crashing in, and, well, sometimes you cry.</p>
<p>And so it was at the Bad Seeds’ concert at the Manchester Arena, in your hometown, Sarah. I remember that concert so vividly. It was four months after the terrorist bombing, where twenty-three people died and untold were wounded, physically and psychologically. It was one of the first gigs in the Manchester Arena since it had re-opened, and there was a feeling of real defiance in the room, of course, but a terrible sadness too, I thought, at the sheer monstrousness of it all. A sadness because we understood that evil does walk among us, and that none of us has any real control over our destinies, that we are all tossed around by the arbitrary winds of fate and who ever really knows what is going to happen next?</p>
<p>At that concert in Manchester Arena, with these thoughts going through my mind, I felt an intense common bond with the audience, that became in the end almost overwhelming and which I will never forget. The unrestrained release at the end of the show was a deliverance for us all.</p>
<p>So to answer your question, Sarah, generally my own songs don’t make me cry, but sometimes I cry all the same. How can we not?</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

					<p>Dear Ptolemy,</p>
<p>I think I may have already answered your question at the In Conversations in Hobart &#8211; if you’re the little blonde kid, who was sitting on the right side of the hall. I can’t remember exactly what I replied, but I thought more about the question after the show, and I remember wishing I had answered it better.</p>
<p>Perhaps, this is what I should have said. Listening to Bad Seeds music at your age is like having a secret knowledge. When I was about your age I had a secret knowledge too. My eldest brother, Tim, used to listen to a lot of very strange and obscure music and he passed this knowledge on to me. Back then I lived in a rural city in Victoria and it seemed to me that nobody my age listened to the music my brother played to me. As far as I could tell they all listened to a whole lot of shit. It was like I carried a secret around inside me, a special knowledge about the world that my friends didn’t have. It was a secret power. I carried this secret power with me all through my kid-years until I went to a school in Melbourne, where I met three or four other people who also had this special knowledge – this secret power. These people became my best friends and we went on to form a band and tried, in our way, to take this knowledge and pass it on to the world.</p>
<p>This secret knowledge you have is a strength that lives only inside certain people. It is a strength that will inspire you to do wondrous things &#8211; like write stories, or draw pictures, or build rockets that fly to Mars. It will give you the courage to take on anything that the world might put in front of you. It’s a wild power that can be of untold value to the world.  Your name, Ptolemy, is a warrior’s name. A boy full of inspiration with a warrior’s name! The world is waiting for you. Blow ‘em away, kid.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

<h1 class="post-title">During one of the &#8216;In Conversation&#8217; events, you mentioned that you look to some poets for inspiration in your songwriting. Which ones?</h1>
<h3>KATIE, PERTH, AUSTRALIA</h3>
</div>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Astrid and Katie,</span></p>
<p>I have always read a lot of poetry. It’s part of my job as a songwriter. I try to read, at the very least, a half-hour of poetry a day, before I begin to do my own writing. It jimmies open the imagination, making the mind more receptive to metaphor and abstraction and serves as a bridge from the reasoned mind to a stranger state of alertness, in case that precious idea decides to drop by.</p>
<p>Sometimes the reading is something of a chore and there are many “great” poets I find boring, inscrutable, long-winded and painful to read. They can be bad news for the imaginative process.</p>
<p>However, I have a few poets that, purely on a personal level, always delight and are a simple pleasure to read. There are enough surprises within their writing to keep the mind light and alive. This is by no means a definitive list and in no particular order. I’m just sitting here at my desk looking at my bookshelf, in fact. They are poets whose company I consistently enjoy.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stevie Smith</p>
<p>Frederick Seidel</p>
<p>William Blake</p>
<p>Sherwood Anderson</p>
<p>Rae Armantrout</p>
<p>Langston Hughes</p>
<p>E. E. Cummings</p>
<p>W. B. Yeats</p>
<p>John Berryman</p>
<p>Sylvia Plath</p>
<p>Thomas Hardy</p>
<p>Philip Larkin</p>
<p>Emily Dickinson</p>
<p>Sharon Olds</p>
<p>W. H. Auden</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to say, my list, in this instance, is of poets writing in the English language, for no other reason than to make the list more manageable.</p>
<p>Beyond this list, there are various poetry anthologies which are always an education and an immense pleasure to dive into, most notably those put together by the great Jerome Rothenberg &#8211; among them Barbaric, Vast and Wild, Shaking the Pumpkin, A Big Jewish Book, America a Prophesy and Technicians of the Sacred. (See Red Hand File #5).</p>
<p>Much love, Nick</p>

		<title>Nick Cave - The Red Hand Files - Issue #24 - In your response to an audience question in Brisbane, I am bothered that you dismissed the idea of leaving a legacy - that it didn&#039;t matter what you left behind. I&#039;d like to challenge you on this. A body of artistic work, that has also had an enormous personal impact on the lives of many people - given meaning, comfort, joy and hope, and shaped their world views - is a legacy to be acknowledged and respected.

					<p>Dear Angelina,</p>
<p>I very much take your point &#8211; my answer was dismissive and unhelpful. As you point out, it undermined the relationship with my work that other people may have. I’m sorry about that. I very much appreciate you writing in and pushing back against my statement.</p>
<p>What I should have said is that I am still actively engaged in the business of songwriting and doing everything in my power to stay afloat. This is not as easy as it may appear and involves a certain amount of self-deception. Part of that process is to occasionally affect a dismissive attitude toward my earlier songs, as if my best work is still ahead of me. How could I continue to write if I believed otherwise? Here, most probably, truth collides with necessity. We look to what ought to be rather than what is. The newly formed song needs all the support it can get to front up to the impossible weight of the hundreds of songs I have already written. Indeed, how can the new idea ever hope to compete with the deep attachment that people seem to have with those past and treasured songs?</p>
<p>I am dancing on water lilies when I write and one’s heritage can have a terrifying tonnage. I must remain one step ahead of the songs, optimistically hopping from lily pad to lily pad, and doing my best to ignore the great dark wave of work that is building up behind me. How many artists have we seen stop and turn around to look, only to literally drown in a pool of their own legacy.</p>
<p>I am sure a time will come, Angelina &#8211; perhaps in the not too distant future &#8211; when I can sit back like some loony old patriarch and cast a weepy eye over my legacy, as they wheel me on stage to receive my ‘Lifetime Achievement Award&#8217;, but not this year, please, I beg you, not this year.</p>
<p>With Love, Nick</p>

		<title>Nick Cave - The Red Hand Files - Issue #23 - Three and a half years ago I lost my wife and I was left to take care of my (then 2 year old) daughter. She&#039;s a happy little girl but I know she&#039;s happiest when her father is happy. I&#039;ve been finding it hard to find happiness. It&#039;s not my loss - I made peace with that a while back. I just haven&#039;t found my life again. You&#039;re a happy man. We all get that vibe when we see you play live. Has it always been this way, have you always been able to cut through the heavy moments in life to enjoy living? : The Red Hand Files</title>

					<p>Dear William,</p>
<p>Thank you for your question. Please accept this answer, in the spirit that it is given, as a simple and supportive response to your letter.</p>
<p>It seems to me that you are reacting entirely appropriately to a devastating situation that has ransacked your life. This is not what you signed up for when you got married &#8211; to be alone and looking after your little daughter. When you said that you have made peace with the death of your wife, this may on some level be true, but the residual feelings of aloneness, loss of control, and cosmic betrayal must still hold a powerful sway over your life. No wonder you can’t find your life. That life you once had does not exist. You have a new life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">No wonder you can&#8217;t find your life. That life you once had does not exist. You have a new life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three and a half years have passed, for both of us. We feel we should be better. We feel equilibrium should be restored. We feel we have in someway failed and that we should have made peace with the world. We feel people must be sick to death of us, and our fucking <em>grief</em>. But grief is beyond our control; it is omnipotent and invincible and we are miniscule in its presence and when it comes for us, all we can do is to kneel before it, heads bowed and await its passing.</p>
<p>But, as you know, grief is also tidal. In time, it can recede and leave us with feelings of peace and advancement, only for it to wash back in with all its crushing hopelessness and sorrow. Back and forth it goes, but with each retreating drift of despair, we are left a little stronger, more resilient, more essential and better at our new life. I can feel these tides of anguish and restoration move through your words. They say so much about grief, but also the sanctity of fatherhood. What a glorious thing fatherhood is! Within your words, William, great hope resides, for you, for your daughter, and for us all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">They say so much about grief, but also the sanctity of fatherhood. What a glorious thing fatherhood is!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing, of course, happens fast enough and we just want to be returned to that uncomplicated life we once had &#8211; we want stability restored &#8211; but it is not to be. Now we have a new life; unchartered, uncertain, beyond our control, and that we are on some level undertaking alone, even within the company of the ones we love. Our worlds are still raw and new. They hum with suffering, but there is immense power there too.</p>
<p>We are alone but we are also connected in a personhood of suffering. We have reached out to each other, with nothing to offer, but an acceptance of our mutual despair. We must understand that the depths of our anguish signal the heights we can, in time, attain. This is an act of extraordinary faith. It makes demands on the vast reserves of inner-strength that you may not even be aware of. But they are there. As your little daughter dances through her father’s tears, she leads the way. The way lies there before us.</p>
<p>With love, Nick.</p>

					<div>Dear Peter,</p>
<p>In Yuval Noah Harari’s brilliant new book <em>21 Lessons for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century, </em>he writes that Artificial Intelligence, with its limitless potential and connectedness, will ultimately render many humans redundant in the work place. This sounds entirely feasible. However, he goes on to say that AI will be able to write better songs than humans can. He says, and excuse my simplistic summation, that we listen to songs to make us feel certain things and that in the future AI will simply be able to map the individual mind and create songs tailored exclusively to our own particular mental algorithms, that can make us feel, with far more intensity and precision, whatever it is we want to feel. If we are feeling sad and want to feel happy we simply listen to our bespoke AI happy song and the job will be done.</p>
<p>But, I am not sure that this is all songs do. Of course, we go to songs to make us feel something – happy, sad, sexy, homesick, excited or whatever &#8211; but this is not all a song does. What a great song makes us feel is a sense of awe. There is a reason for this. A sense of awe is almost exclusively predicated on our limitations as human beings. It is entirely to do with our audacity as humans to reach beyond our potential.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">A sense of awe is almost exclusively predicated on our limitations as human beings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is perfectly conceivable that AI could produce a song as good as Nirvana’s <em>Smells Like Teen Spirit</em>, for example, and that it ticked all the boxes required to make us feel what a song like that should make us feel – in this case, excited and rebellious, let’s say. It is also feasible that AI could produce a song that makes us feel these same feelings, but more intensely than any human songwriter could do.</p>
<p>But, I don’t feel that when we listen to <em>Smells Like Teen Spirit</em> it is only the song that we are listening to. It feels to me, that what we are actually listening to is a withdrawn and alienated young man’s journey out of the small American town of Aberdeen – a young man who by any measure was a walking bundle of dysfunction and human limitation – a young man who had the temerity to howl his particular pain into a microphone and in doing so, by way of the heavens, reach into the hearts of a generation. We are also listening to Iggy Pop walk across his audience’s hands and smear himself in peanut butter whilst singing <em>1970</em>. We are listening to Beethoven compose the <em>Ninth Symphony</em> while almost totally deaf. We are listening to Prince, that tiny cluster of purple atoms, singing in the pouring rain at the Super Bowl and blowing everyone’s minds. We are listening to Nina Simone stuff all her rage and disappointment into the most tender of love songs. We are listening to Paganini continue to play his Stradivarius as the strings snapped. We are listening to Jimi Hendrix kneel and set fire to his own instrument. </p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">We are listening to Jimi Hendrix kneel and set fire to his own instrument.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What we are actually listening to is human limitation and the audacity to transcend it. Artificial Intelligence, for all its unlimited potential, simply doesn’t have this capacity. How could it? And this is the essence of transcendence. If we have limitless potential then what is there to transcend? And therefore what is the purpose of the imagination at all. Music has the ability to touch the celestial sphere with the tips of its fingers and the awe and wonder we feel is in the desperate temerity of the reach, not just the outcome. Where is the transcendent splendour in unlimited potential? So to answer your question, Peter, AI would have the capacity to write a good song, but not a great one. It lacks the nerve.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

I&#039;ve taken Nocturama with me to battles; it has whispered and screamed me to sleep; it has proven to be a true friend through assorted trials - when and where all other musicks failed; it is a lot of things, not one thing, it conjures the night during the day and the day during endless-seeming nights; it is of thresholds, nether-places, about leaps of faith, the bravery of leaving old riches and old rots behind; and I shall front its detractors and enemies, alone if needs be, until the day I die - and am buried while they play Bring It On. Whatever did you think. Nocturama is not a failure. It is a breakthrough. It is a musical monument marking rebirth. It is alive.

</div>
<div>
<p>Dear Delilah, Anne, Miguel and Faduma,</p>
<p>Nocturama is held in such universal contempt that its very title has become a byword for failure or disaster. “He tried his best but ultimately he met his Nocturama,” you may hear someone say, or perhaps “What a complete and utter Nocturama!” As the years have passed, the disdain for this record has not diminished, and Nocturama has become just another word for ‘loser’ – as in “Fuck you, you fucking Nocturama!” and still it continues to this day, so that when a Bad Seeds fan gets poked in the eye or kicked in the nuts, they cry, “<em>Nocturama!”</em></p>
<p>Therefore it comes as no surprise that many of the questions I have received on The Red Hand Files circle around the failings of this sad, brave, little record.</p>
<p>Personally, I like Nocturama. I like that it is out there, moving around the place and spoiling things. I like it that someone may accidently play it at a party and people start throwing up in the ashtrays. I like it that everyone stands upwind from it. I especially like it that of the sixteen records the Bad Seeds have produced we only have one Nocturama, whereas with some bands half their records are Nocturamas, and with most bands <em>all</em> of their records are Nocturamas.</p>
<p>I think that in the end we all need our Nocturamas. Your Nocturama may, indeed, be the most important thing you ever do. Failure fortifies us. It moves us forward. It strips everything back to its essential nature and leaves us clean and pure, ready to begin again. You don’t create something as problematic as Nocturama without a certain risk and a little courage and the temerity to fail. I love this troubled record for that. It may just be my favourite.</p>
<p>Much love to you all, Nick</p>

<h3>GISELA, PORTO, PORTUGAL</h3>
</div>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Jonathan and Gisela,</span></p>
<p>I’m writing this very early in the morning from Brisbane. I played an ‘In Conversations’ show last night and sat up talking with people afterwards.</p>
<p>As I take these events around the country, I am meeting audiences who are asking thoughtful, fearless and challenging questions, many of which have resonated deeply with me. So it is with The Red Hand Files. When I started the Files I had a small idea that people were in need of more thoughtful discourse. I felt a similar need. I felt that social media was by its nature undermining both nuance and connectivity. I thought that, for my fans at least, The Red Hand Files could go some way to remedy that. The number and breadth of questions I have received over the last three months has been staggering, indeed, many are not questions at all, but people using the Files to tell their own stories. It is a privilege to read these pieces of writing and it is both a pleasure and an honour to stand on stage before you all.</p>
<p>And now, to your question, Gisela!</p>
<p>If I had to be a flower, I would be a bluebell.</p>
<p>I remember lying under the old Yew tree in Kew Gardens with my wife, Susie, in a vast field of bluebells. It was year 2000 and we would visit the gardens often that spring. It was a magical time, full of excitement and promise. Susie was heavily pregnant with the twins and we could barely contain ourselves, as we lay there in the shade of the ancient tree, with the children growing inside her, as the momentary bluebells looked on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Now we sit beneath the knotted Yew</em></p>
<p><em>And the bluebells bob around our shoes</em></p>
<p><em>The task of remembering the tell-tale clues</em></p>
<p><em>Goes to my sorrowful wife</em></p>
<p><em>Who is counting the days on her fingers</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much love, Nick</p>

					<div>
<p>Dear Jenny,</p>
<p>As I drove into Wangaratta, the town I grew up in, with my eighteen year old son sitting beside me, Ausmuteants blaring through the sound system, I had an uncanny, dizzying feeling that my childhood was no longer in the past, as one would expect, but rolling out in front of me, and the child I thought I could see shimmering in the heat and walking down the road toward me, was, in fact, myself.</p>
<p>It was nearly fifty years ago that I left Wangaratta and I was anxious about a lot of things, but mostly that this town I had conjured up so many times in my songs and novels would be unrecognisable to me now. I was anxious that my imagination might have overridden the truth of the town to fit the narrative purposes of my songs. I was afraid that it would feel as if I were simply in the wrong place – that it would feel unauthentic, a fabrication &#8211; so long have I lived away from the town and so long I have lived inside my songs.</p>
<p>But as we drove around the town and visited the places I knew so well as a child &#8211; the Railway Hotel, the Wangaratta Cathedral, the rusted railway bridge, the High School, the muddy Ovens River, the swimming pool, my house in Mepunga Ave &#8211; I was amazed at how little the town had changed and how close to the truth my songs actually were. It seemed to me, that so many of the songs and stories I had written were simply guides to “the idea of a river, an open space and a small town” in the North East of Victoria.</p>
<p>But still the strange feeling of vertigo persisted. I felt that I had caught up to the vision of the child shimmering on the road in the sun and found that it was my childhood self &#8211; and that child would be the one who would take my hand and lead me back through the old town, who would show me around; but further than that, my child-self would tug at my sleeve, and guide me down to the river and ultimately, in the final hour, take me across it, to the other side, wherever that may be.</p>
<p>When I stood on stage in Wangaratta, I was overcome by the warmth of the audience and their total lack of resentment for some of the unfortunate things I had said about Wangaratta in the past. These were foolish things to say because these comments were not just an affront to the town itself but to the child that inhabited the town, for indeed these two things are one and the same.</p>
<p>When I visited the cathedral, where I had spent every Sunday morning and Tuesday night yawning my way through morning mass and evensong as a chorister, I was overwhelmed &#8211; this holy place had, without me even knowing it, forged so many of my ideas about the world that remain true to me to this day. The Dean of the church had kindly opened it for us. He had come to the church because someone had snapped the head off the plaster baby Jesus in the Christmas Nativity scene. “He’s been decapitated,” said the Dean, quietly. We have made contact with the church to offer a contribution to help restore the infant Jesus&#8217; head to his body. It seems the very least I can do, all things considered.</p>
<p>So, Jenny, to answer your question – to stand before the people of Wangaratta was a special kind of privilege. It felt restorative, like a circle completed.</p>
<p>With love, Nick</p>

					<p>Dear Cindy,</p>
<p>If you were ever to apply for a job as a personal assistant and in the interview your potential employer asks you the following question –</p>
<p>“If the world was going to end in 72 hours and I asked you to send a short email, what would your reply be?</p>
<p>A) Consider it done.</p>
<p>B) Send your own damn email.”</p>
<p>&#8211; my advice would be to choose option A.</p>
<p>Actually, I asked Rachel, my assistant of twenty years, if, in fact, she would send the email if there was only 72 hours left before the end of the world, and she said no, she wouldn’t, because she’d probably be picking up my dry cleaning.</p>
<p>With Love, Nick</p>

<h1 class="post-title">Can you put together a list of your top five albums and ask Warren Ellis to do the same?</h1>
<h3>WILLIAM, PERTH, AUSTRALIA</h3>
</div>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Dear G and William,</span></p>
<p>In my extended poem, “The Sick Bag Song”, I wrote about Leonard Cohen and the effect that he had on me as a young boy when I first heard him sing.</p>
<p><em>“Leonard Cohen will sing, and the boy will suddenly breathe as if for the first time, and fall inside the laughing man’s voice and hide.</em></p>
<p><em>The boy will grow older, and over time there will be other songs – not many – ten or maybe twenty in a lifespan, that stand apart from the rest of the music he will discover. He will realise that not only are these songs sacred, they are ‘hiding songs’ that deal exclusively in darkness, obfuscation, concealment and secrecy. He will realise that for him the purpose of these songs was to shut off the sun, to draw a long shadow down and protect him from the corrosive glare of the world.”</em></p>
<h1 class="post-title" style="text-align: center;">*</h1>
<p>Occasionally people have asked me what those ‘hiding songs’ were. I have never revealed them in their entirety. Perhaps, I felt a strange ownership over them and that to release them to the world may constitute a form of betrayal. Do you ever feel like that about songs &#8211; that they were designed with you especially in mind, and that no one could ever begin to understand them in the way you do? My ‘hiding songs’ serve as a form of refuge for me and have done so for years. They are songs that I can pull over myself, like a child might pull the bed covers over their head, when the blaze of the world becomes too intense. I can literally hide inside them. They are the essential pillars that hold up the structure of my artistic world. There are hundreds of other favourite songs, of course, and one day maybe I can do a list of some of those, but not today. Today, I give you the ‘hiding songs’.</p>
<p>G and William (and anyone else, for that matter), I’d be interested to know if you have any ‘hiding songs’, and if so what they are. You know where to find me!</p>
<p><strong>10 HIDING SONGS</strong></p>
<p>Avalanche, Leonard Cohen</p>
<p>Katie Cruel, Karen Dalton</p>
<p>On the Beach, Neil Young</p>
<p>Tupelo, John Lee Hooker</p>

<p>Becalmed, Brian Eno</p>
<p>One Fine Morning, Bill Callahan</p>
<h1 class="post-title" style="text-align: center;">*</h1>
<p>William, I called Warren in Paris. He was happy to make you a list of his top five albums.</p>

					<p>Dear Carolina,<br />
Just to be clear, I did in fact mention my sons in the second Freak The Fuck Out answer – Issue #12. I said, “I would gather my family together, hold them tightly, and speak some comforting words…” The family I am referring to is my wife and my sons.</p>
<p>You are, however, correct in pointing out that I omitted to mention my band members and, as I read your question, I felt a pang of shame to think that we were all going to be atomised in 72 hours and I had not attempted to say goodbye to them. In my defence, there are very real problems in contacting The Bad Seeds. Firstly, only George answers the phone when I call. Tommy &amp; Marty rarely go near telephones &#8211; Tommy has full-blown telephobia and the ever-elusive Marty hasn’t, as far as I can tell, unboxed the Apple iPhone XS Max recently bought for him (at great expense) by our management. Larry only does social media, which I don’t know how to do, and to contact Jim, I have to go through his wife, who I like very much, but who isn’t speaking to me at the moment. Warren and I are so spiritually aligned that we communicate telepathically, which is fortunate as he never rings me back when I call, rather he messages me saying he will ‘call back later’, which he rarely, if ever, does. I have a terrible, lurking suspicion that none of The Bad Seeds like me very much. What I should &#8211; or would &#8211; therefore do, is contact my assistant, Rachel, and have her send out a group email. The email would say:</p>
<h1 class="post-title" style="text-align: center;">***</h1>
<p>Dear Bad Seeds,</p>
<p>As we only have 72 hours until our mutual annihilation, I will keep this brief. You are the very best there is. It has been an honour working with you.</p>
<p>With love to you all,</p>
<p>Nick</p>
<p>PS After much thought I have decided to give you all a bonus. It will be deposited into your account within three working days.</p>
<h1 class="post-title" style="text-align: center;">***</h1>
<p>Then, I would go back to my family – my wife, my sons, my dogs, my Brian Eno records – and continue to freak the fuck out!</p>
<p>Much love, Nick</p>

<h3>BAM, BRIGHTON, UK</h3>
</div>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Catherine and Bam,</span></p>
<p>My mother gave me much advice over the years on how to live a decent life. Sadly, I didn’t take that much notice of it. Mostly though, she simply allowed me to be myself, to make my own mistakes and to find my own way. She served, and still serves, as a reminder that it is entirely possible to lead an ethical life where we can be kind and careful and welcoming and, most of all, take responsibility for our actions and not complain or blame others for our own misfortunes. She continues to lead a life of great integrity – she is ninety-two &#8211; but it is not without a certain acerbic humour and a wry eye for the absurdities of the world.</p>
<p>But there was one piece of advice my mother gave me some years ago that affected me deeply and was of enormous practical value in my life. I can’t tell you how often I have brought it to mind and acted accordingly, and how much strength and moral fortitude it has afforded me. So often I have read questions in The Red Hand Files from people who feel lost, marginalised, lonely, scared of their creative impulses, freakish, less than, manipulated, silenced, bullied at school and all the rest, and my mother’s words often come to mind.</p>
<p>I had been awarded an honorary doctorate by Monash University in Melbourne and my mother accompanied me to the university to receive it. I was feeling a little intimidated by the whole thing because I was stepping out of my rock ‘n’ roll comfort zone, in-to the academic sphere and the whole affair had me feeling quite uncomfortable. I mentioned this to my mother, and as we stepped out of the car into the university grounds, she said,</p>
<p>“Head high and fuck ‘em all.”</p>
<p>I am passing this crucial piece of maternal wisdom on to you Bam and Catherine &#8211; and to the rest of you out there. It is my mother’s gift to you.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

					<p>Dear Christopher, </p>
<p>I have received a number of messages broadly relating to this issue, so perhaps this is an opportunity to address this matter by sharing some actual correspondence I had with Brian Eno about it. After announcing my decision to play two shows in Israel at the end of my world tour last year, Brian emailed me in the hope of persuading me to reconsider this decision. Below is my reply, which may go some way to answering your question.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h1 class="post-title" style="text-align: center;">***</h1>
<p>Dear Brian,</p>
<p>Clearly the decision for The Bad Seeds to play in Israel is contentious for some people. But to be clear on this: I do not support the current government in Israel, yet do not accept that my decision to play in the country is any kind of tacit support for that government’s policies. Nor do I condone the atrocities that you have described; nor am I ignorant of them. I am aware of the injustices suffered by the Palestinian population, and wish, with all people of good conscience, that their suffering is ended via a comprehensive and just solution, one that involves enormous political will on both sides of the equation.</p>
<p>But I also do not support the Boycott, Divestments and Sanctions movement, as you know. I think the cultural boycott of Israel is cowardly and shameful. In fact, this is partly the reason I am playing Israel – not as support for any particular political entity but as a principled stand against those who wish to bully, shame and silence musicians. I don&#8217;t intend to engage in a detailed discussion as to how the boycott of Israel can be seen to be anti-Semitic at heart and, furthermore, does not work (rather, it risks further entrenching positions in Israel in opposition to those you support), but even the estimable Noam Chomsky considers the BDS as lacking legitimacy and inherently hypocritical. What we actually have here is a fundamental difference of opinion as to what the purpose of music is. </p>
<p>It struck me while writing this how much more powerful a statement you could make if you were to go to Israel and tell the press and the Israeli people how you feel about their current regime, then do a concert on the understanding that the purpose of your music was to speak to the Israeli people&#8217;s better angels. That would have a much greater effect than a boycott. Now imagine if the 1,200 UK artists who signed your list did the same thing. Perhaps the Israelis would respond in a wholly different way than they would to just yet more age-old rejectionism. Ultimately, whatever the rights and wrongs of official Israeli action in the disputed territories, Israel is a real, vibrant, functioning democracy – yes, with Arab members of parliament – and so engaging with Israelis, who vote, may be more helpful than scaring off artists or shutting down means of engagement. </p>
<p>All the best to you,</p>
<p>Nick</p>
<h1 class="post-title" style="text-align: center;">***</h1>
<p>I want to just add that Brian Eno, beyond any other musician, taught my friends and me how to make music. The records he made remain some of the most important and essential recordings I have ever heard. So, if there seems to be a thread of anguish that runs through this letter, this is indeed the case. I am writing to my hero. </p>
<p>Even so, certain questions need to be asked. How far must we have strayed from the transformative nature of music to feel justified in weaponising music and using it to punish ordinary Israeli citizens for the actions of their government. Furthermore, what has brought us to the point where certain musicians feel it is ethically sound to use forms of coercion and intimidation, in the form of ‘open’ letters, on fellow musicians who don’t agree with their point of view? </p>
<p>Occasionally, I wonder if The Bad Seeds did the right thing in playing Israel. I cannot answer that question. I understand and accept the validity of many of the arguments that are presented to me. Indeed, some of my dearest friends in the music industry found my decision very difficult to accept, but there it is, after much consideration the decision was made: I simply could not treat my Israeli fans with the necessary contempt to do Brian Eno’s bidding. </p>
<p>Much love, Nick</p>

					<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Dear James,</span></p>
<p class="Body">Okay, good point. First off, I would investigate the person who was making the claim to see if they were a reliable source of information and not some lunatic on the street with a cardboard sign. If the person making the claim seemed credible, I would look at the reason why the world was going to end. If it was scientific in nature such as an impact event with an asteroid (which would make sense since we had been given 72 hours notice), rather than say, a random nuclear attack (where we would be given no such warning), or AI undermining us to the point of non-existence, or over-population, or all humans losing the will to live at the same time (a distinct possibility), or a catastrophic fungal pandemic, or extreme weather (all of which would happen incrementally, not in exactly 72 hours) then I would go to the appropriate channels and check out the science.</p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">If there was a consensus among scientists, who, after all, are in the business of knowing stuff &#8211; stuff like, for example, climate change, the mother of all apocalyptic fears, where </span>97% <span lang="EN-US">of scientists ascribe the cause to humankind &#8211; I would probably take their word for it and not be so negligent as to deny their projection.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">I would then proceed to do everything I could to stop it. I would make a call to my friend Bono. If even Bono couldn</span>’<span lang="NL">t stop </span><span lang="EN-US">it, and there was simply no hope &#8211; with annihilation absolutely and unambiguously inevitable &#8211; I would gather my family together, hold them tightly and speak some comforting words. </span>I would take their hands and pray quietly for a moment, because collective prayer can have a calming effect, and I would pray to the <em>possibility</em> of a god, and that the afterlife was a Christian one (where my family and I may have a slim chance of getting in) and not a Muslim one (where we wouldn’t) or a Hindu one (where we may all come back as cockroaches) or a Jewish one (which, as far as I can make out, is pretty much bad news for <em>everyone).</em></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">I would ring my mother. I would pet the dogs. I would then turn to my wife, look into her lovely eyes, push a strand of hair from her face and quietly tell her that I loved her, have always loved her and would continue to love her till the end of the world. Then, and only then, would I, with great force of meaning and extreme prejudice, </span><em><span lang="EN-US">freak the fuck out.</span></em></p>

</div>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Ali, Maggie, João and Peter and the many people who have asked similar God related questions.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">I’ve been circling around the idea of God for decades. It’s been a slow creep around the periphery of His Majesty, pen in hand, trying to write God alive. Sometimes, I think, I have almost succeeded. The more I become willing to open my mind to the unknown, my imagination to the impossible and my heart to the notion of the divine, the more God becomes apparent. I think we get what we are willing to believe, and that our experience of the world extends exactly to the limits of our interest and credence. I am interested in the idea of possibility and uncertainty. Possibility, by its very nature, extends beyond provable facts, and uncertainty propels us forward. I try to meet the world with an open and curious mind, insisting on nothing other than the freedom to look beyond what we think we know. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span lang="EN-US">I think we get what we are willing to believe.</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Does God exist? I don’t have any evidence either way, but I am not sure that is the right question. For me, the question is what it means to believe. The thing is, against all my better judgement, I find it impossible <em>not</em> to believe, or at the very least not to be engaged in the <em>inquiry</em> of such a thing, which in a way is the same thing. My life is dominated by the notion of God, whether it is His presence or His absence. I am a believer – in both God’s presence and His absence. I am a believer in the inquiry itself, more so than the result of that inquiry. As an extension of this belief, my songs are questions, rarely answers. </span></p>
<p>In the end, with all respect, I haven’t the stomach for atheism and its insistence on what we know. It feels like a dead end to me, unhelpful and bad for the business of writing. I share many of the problems that atheists have toward religion – the dogma, the extremism, the hypocrisy, the concept of revelation with its many attendant horrors – I am just at variance with the often self-satisfied certainty that accompanies the idea that God does not exist. It is simply not in my nature. I have, for better or for worse, a predisposition toward perverse and contradictory thinking. Perhaps this is something of a curse, but the idea of uncertainty, of <em>not knowing</em>, is the creative engine that drives everything I do. I may well be living a delusion, I don’t know, but it is a serviceable one that greatly improves my life, both creatively and otherwise.</p>
<p>So, do I believe in God? Well, I <em>act</em> like I do, for my own greater good. Does God exist? Maybe, I don’t know. Right now, God is a work in progress.</p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

					<p>Dear Irina,</p>
<p>Vicious killers had kidnapped Warren. The kidnappers had emailed me a list of demands. I had to write a letter back agreeing to their demands. The letter I was composing was in exactly the same format as a Red Hand Files issue, with the same blood red Cambria font, the same cream coloured background. The problem was I was having a technical issue formatting the letter. The letters kept scrambling. The font kept changing. The little red hand logo wouldn’t stand up. Time was running out. I woke up, shaking.</p>
<p>I had read your question regarding dreams before I went to sleep that night. Your question must have provoked this dream, as it is the first remembered dream I have had in a very long time. </p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">We are professional dreamers. We work, therefore we dream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think there is a reason for this. As a songwriter, most of my waking life is spent in a kind of dream time. Many writers will tell you the same. We are professional dreamers. We work, therefore we dream. Even when I am not at my desk writing, and am going about my ‘normal’ life, the residual trails of the words I’ve been working on still weave around me like dreams. </p>
<p>For this reason, my actual dreaming while asleep does not feel particularly active. At least, not at the moment. I hardly ever remember anything I dream and if I do, images that are thrown up are rarely useful in my work. I never write them down.</p>
<p>Having said that, I wrote this dream down. It’s for you. Thank you for awakening it. I rang Warren. He seems to be okay. </p>
<p>Much love, Nick</p>

					<p>Dear Jo,</p>
<p>Creativity is not something that can disappear. The creative impulse is simply the strategy used to catch ideas. Ideas are everywhere and forever available, provided you are prepared to accept them. This takes a certain responsibility to the artistic process. There is discipline and rigour and preparation involved. You must prove yourself worthy of the idea.</p>
<h1 class="post-title" style="text-align: center;">***</h1>
<p>I have rarely sat down at my desk with something to say, other than I am ready. The sitting comes first, turning up with a certain alertness to possibility. Only then does the idea feel free to settle. It settles small and very tentatively, then, through your active attention, it can grow into something much bigger. Sitting in a readied state can sometimes last a long and anxious time.  But you must not despair! I have never found a situation where the idea refuses to come to the prepared mind.</p>
<h1 class="post-title" style="text-align: center;">***</h1>
<p>While you are in this prepared state, be the thing you want to be. If it is a writer, then write. Initially, stream of consciousness is fine. Write without judgement and self-condemnation. Write playfully and recklessly. Even if this initial writing appears of little value, keep going, for the beautiful idea has awakened and is moving toward you, as it responds to your display of intent.</p>
<h1 class="post-title" style="text-align: center;">***</h1>
<p>The idea is especially designed for you in your uniqueness.  If you are not there to receive it, or indeed you are not yourself when it arrives or, heaven forbid, disguised as someone else, the idea may scare and vanish away and be lost forever. It is you that it is searching for and you alone. Be yourself. The idea is moving closer.</p>
<h1 class="post-title" style="text-align: center;">***</h1>
<p>Ideas are timid things, in my experience. They come as whispers and you need to hold them in honest regard in order to receive them. Perhaps the idea is as scared as you. Perhaps the idea is as invisible as you may sometimes feel. It may be that the idea is simply mirroring your internal self and is reluctant to settle in a mind that is heavy with uncertainty, and that is repeating ancient mantras of self-doubt. These voices can best be banished by a spirited disobedience, a playful defiance. Disobey the voices by continuing to write. They are a lot less robust than they appear. The idea is closing in.</p>
<h1 class="post-title" style="text-align: center;">***</h1>
<p>So, Jo, here are some suggestions as to what to do:</p>
<p>Sit down. Be yourself. Be prepared. Be attentive. Defy the voices. Be the thing you want to be. Write. Be playful. Be reckless. Remember that you are uniquely designed for the idea that is moving toward you. You are good enough. The idea is about to arrive. </p>
<p>Love, Nick</p>

I ask this not only because of current events, but also because throughout all the iterations of your work, you have addressed women with adoration, irreverence, worship, disdain, respect, horror, empathy and well, the list goes on. It’s a fascinating range in general, especially for someone who seems to clearly be a supporter of women, female artists, and a bit of the misandry.

							CAPTURING SUSIE AT THE FORUM, LOS ANGELES IN OCTOBER 2018							</p>

				<div>

					<p>Dear Merritt,</p>
<p>Thank you for your kind words. I find them very encouraging because, every now and then, my songs draw the disdain of certain people who believe that the way I represent women in my songs is reductive and objectifying and somehow does insult to the notion of womanhood. I think at heart they may feel a discomfort at the undue interest I pay to women in my songs – and to give the devil his due, women are indeed a singular obsession. </p>
<p>The truth is I have very little understanding of women at all, they remain deep mysteries containing multitudes – and this is exactly why I enjoy writing about them. It is their feral energy and their seemingly limitless capacity for wonder that, for me, is their undying attraction, both on the page and off. Twenty years on and I am still trying to define Susie, my wife, in song, but it’s a losing battle. I have come to see that there is a wild and mercurial energy within her that my words will never contain, and that this bright energy is connected to her own singular and restless fascination with the world. It has little to do with me.</p>
<p>As to the recent “cultural sea changes” affecting women, I feel that they are in danger of eroding those bright edges of personhood, and grinding them down into monotonous identity politics – where some women have traded in their inherent wildness and sense of awe, for a one-size-fits-all protestation against a uniform concept of maleness which I’m not sure I recognise.</p>
<p>Whatever happened between us, it saddens me that something of our individual nature has disappeared into the divide, our unique voices are being worn down and everyone is communicating within the safe and strident anti-wonder of grievance politics. </p>
<p>As to whether this cultural sea change would make me more cautious with what I write, well, I’m not sure. It feels like time itself serves as a sort of corrective and there are lyrics I wrote back then which I simply wouldn’t write now, just as my younger self would probably look at what I write now and roll his crazed and blood-shot eyes in scorn. I would hope that the general shift in my lyrics is towards a compassion that is human by nature, rather than tribal. That is not divisive or exclusionary, but for everyone. I hope that some of the songs may even draw on that fierce feminine energy – a particular energy I witness when I perform on stage – and also that special sense of female wonder. </p>
<p>Love, Nick<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<div class="extra-question-title">
<h1 class="post-title" style="text-align: center;">It’s clear that Susie is an incredible woman and a creative and intuitive force in your life. How much of her influence do you call on for when you need inspiration and also, do you ever run ideas past her before you put them to the band?</h1>
<h3>NICK, WINDSOR, UK</h3>
<p></div><br />
Dear Nick,</p>
<p>Once I married Susie, I set about trying to capture her. To write about Susie feels like trying to break a code that is constantly rearranging itself. Most of the time, I fail. My songs end up as scraps of paper rustling around the feet of a sixty-foot woman. </p>
<p>I never show her a lyric before it is recorded. This is a matter of survival. I don’t show anybody, anything, actually. I write the lyric, record it with the Bad Seeds, and then offer up the finished songs.</p>
<p>Playing the completed record to Susie for the first time is part pleasure, part terror for both of us. It is difficult to exaggerate how much I care what she thinks and, of course, she knows that I do. I suspect the pressure on her at this moment is immense as she navigates the terminal insecurities of her husband.</p>
<p>Yet the music plays, and the songs come to the rescue and Susie falls inside them and loses herself and sometimes they even get the tears rolling. And there is the pleasure! I suspect some of those tears are tears of relief. Mine are. </p>
<p>Love, Nick. </p>

					<p>Dear Cynthia,</p>
<p>This is a very beautiful question and I am grateful that you have asked it. It seems to me, that if we love, we grieve. That’s the deal. That’s the pact. Grief and love are forever intertwined. Grief is the terrible reminder of the depths of our love and, like love, grief is non-negotiable. There is a vastness to grief that overwhelms our minuscule selves. We are tiny, trembling clusters of atoms subsumed within grief’s awesome presence. It occupies the core of our being and extends through our fingers to the limits of the universe. Within that whirling gyre all manner of madnesses exist; ghosts and spirits and dream visitations, and everything else that we, in our anguish, will into existence. These are precious gifts that are as valid and as real as we need them to be. They are the spirit guides that lead us out of the darkness. </p>
<p>I feel the presence of my son, all around, but he may not be there. I hear him talk to me, parent me, guide me, though he may not be there. He visits Susie in her sleep regularly, speaks to her, comforts her, but he may not be there. Dread grief trails bright phantoms in its wake. These spirits are ideas, essentially. They are our stunned imaginations reawakening after the calamity. Like ideas, these spirits speak of possibility. Follow your ideas, because on the other side of the idea is change and growth and redemption. Create your spirits. Call to them. Will them alive. Speak to them. It is their impossible and ghostly hands that draw us back to the world from which we were jettisoned; better now and unimaginably changed.</p>
<p>With love, Nick. </p>

							WARREN AND ME, IN THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, MEXICO CITY, DISCUSSING THE WISDOM OF REFORMING GRINDERMAN.							</p>
												<!-- /post thumbnail -->
						
											</div>
				</div>
				<div>

					<p>Dear Marvin,</p>
<p>Many of you have asked about the reformation of Grinderman, although most not with the same lurid flair as you, so I sat with Warren and we discussed whether it was a good idea. We both thought the world needed Grinderman, considering its current emotional climate. Warren wanted to wait until Trump got re-elected, in the hope he would invite us to play ‘No Pussy Blues’ at the presidential celebrations. I’m not sure if he was joking or not. I personally felt there was no urgency, and that the older we got, the better Grinderman would be – the more deranged, the more priapic, and the more morally dubious. We both thought that Grinderman appeared to be a lot more popular now than when it existed, and we wondered whether that was simply the band passing into folklore, or whether the world had become, in the last years, more puritanical, less playful, and more hypersensitive, and that there were a lot of people out there, like you Marvin, who just wanted to listen to a band that fucked things up a bit.</p>
<p>We both thought releasing a <em>Best </em><em>o</em><em>f Grinderman </em>record was a good idea. We thought it should be a double album.</p>
<p>Finally, we both didn’t know what a Fourth of July whore was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="extra-question-title">
<h1 class="post-title" style="text-align: center;">Who or what is the monster under your bed?</h1>
<h3>BRIAN, NEW ORLEANS, USA</h3>
<p></div><br />
Dear Brian,</p>
<p>I guess, if I were to look under the bed for monsters, I might expect to find some Islamic terrorists, some man-hating feminists, Trump, some rampant AI, some cyber criminals, some neo-Marxist left-wing radicals, some chemical weapons, some right-wing Nazis, Putin, a nuclear explosion, a meteor, a melted ice cap, heaps of murdered farm animals, Roger Waters, and some very, very bad weather – but actually I think what I would probably find, staring back at me, is <em>myself</em>, because most monsters I have ever had to deal with were usually a product of bad thinking, and generally of my own making. Maybe my greatest fear is that there is nothing under the bed at all, just a vast and monstrous <em>vacancy </em>– dustballs, a child’s lost sock, and the ashy residue of dreams. Sometimes, I would rather not look.</p>
<div class="extra-question-title"></p>
<h1 class="post-title" style="text-align: center;"><em>Technicians of the Sacred</em> by Jerome Rothenberg was placed on the piano in <em>20,000 Days on Earth</em>. Is there anything you would like to share with your readers about this utterly secret/sacred, glorious work of love?</h1>
<h3>BEN, BRISTOL, UK</h3>
<p></div>
<p>Dear Ben,</p>
<p>Obviously you are acquainted with this wonderful book, so this letter is really to the uninitiated!<em> Technicians of the Sacred </em>by Jerome Rothenberg is an anthology of spiritual writings from around the world. It is probably the single most important book on poetry I have ever read. It has been a heavy influence over my songwriting  –  more than I’d like to admit. If there is anyone out there struggling to write lyrics, get your hands on this book; immerse yourselves in it, live inside it for a while, free your mind, and you will emerge brimming with ideas. Jerome Rothenberg recently released a revised edition of <em>Technicians</em>, so it is easily available. For those of you who are interested, this is well worth investigating.</p>

<div class="extra-question-title">
<h1 class="post-title" style="text-align: center;">When you wrote that ‘Miley Cyrus floats in the swimming pool in Toluca Lake’, was she alive or dead when she was floating there?</h1>
<h3>STEPHANIE, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND</h3>
<p></div><br />
Dear Stephanie,</p>
<p>Around 2012, I visited Madame Tussauds Waxworks in Hollywood with my eleven-year-old kids. They became very excited about the waxwork statues of Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus. They explained to me – although not in exactly these terms – that Hannah Montana was the child self, and that Miley Cyrus was the infanticidal adult self, who literally became a wrecking ball that obliterated her younger persona. In my mind, the Miley Cyrus that floats in the swimming pool in the gated community of Toluca Lake, in the song ‘Higgs Boson Blues’, is a statue made of wax. She is neither dead nor alive. She bobs about in the cool water, circled by pink Amazonian dolphins, and melts under a terrible, blank Californian sky, like a pagan sacrifice to an Aztec Sun God. I hope that clears things up a bit, dear Stephanie.</p>
<div class="extra-question-title"></p>
<h1 class="post-title" style="text-align: center;">I counted the words in all your lyrics and thought this might be the only way to tell you some of my results. The most used personal pronouns are ‘I’ (1332) and ‘You’ (970). The word ‘Love’, used as a noun, verb or other form, appears around 280 times, followed by ‘Eye’ or ‘Eyes’ (134) and ‘Night’, ‘Midnight’ or ‘Tonight’ (126). Did you know that you used the word ‘Sorry’ about 73 times? If one takes the most frequently used words (overlooking words like ‘the’, ‘a’, ‘an’ etc.) to build a basic sentence (SVO) it would be: I love you. I’m somehow not surprised, are you?The essence of everything seems to be love, in your lyrics, and all our lives.(Yes, I was bored. Terribly bored.)</h1>
<h3>LARS, COLOGNE, GERMANY</h3>
<p></div>
<p>Dear Lars,<br />
I have printed your piece of writing in its entirety. Your efforts deserve as much.  I have nothing to add, although perhaps I could talk briefly about the strange alliance between boredom and epiphany. Boredom is often dismissed as a lack of imagination – this is not true. Boredom is a signal that we are indeed imaginative creatures, and that the existential distress of being in a state of <em>blah</em> is often the mind readying itself for the epiphany. In your case, Lars, you were ‘terribly bored’. Boredom provoked you to action. You did your crazy statistics. You arrived at the conclusion that love is the essence of everything. By doing so, you have moved the world one step closer to its redemption. Congratulations! You are awesome!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much love, Nick</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>FREDDY, LONDON, UK</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 class="post-title">Why do people take so long to understand the absence of love?</h1>
<h3>PAUL, BRIDGEWATER, TASMANIA</h3>
</div>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Emma, Freddy and Paul,</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Warren officially joined the Bad Seeds when we were working on the Murder Ballads album </span><span lang="EN-US">in 1995</span><span lang="EN-US">. His influence was apparent from the start. Over the years I have developed a relationship with Warren that goes way beyond a professional collaboration and we are the best of friends &#8211; and yes, Emma, we hang out a lot. There is a certain sanctity in this friendship in that it has traversed all manner of troubles over the last twenty or so years, yet remains as resilient as ever. On a professional level we have developed a style of songwriting based almost exclusively on a kind of spiritual intuition and improvisation that feels, as Henry Miller prescribes, calm, joyful and reckless. In the songwriting sessions we sit and focus and grin and crash around in things. Warren is essentially an ideas machine (anyone who has worked in the studio with him will tell you the same) and it is an extraordinary privilege to be around him, both on stage and in the studio &#8211; and anywhere else, actually. When he is in full flight, he is unstoppable, and he is rarely not in full flight.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span lang="EN-US">There is a glass wall between us. We don&#8217;t discuss what we are doing.</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">When we write songs together, we do so in a small studio near Brighton.</span><span lang="EN-US"> I sit in one room with my piano and lyric books and microphone, and Warren sits in another room with his many instruments. There is a glass wall between us. We don</span>’<span lang="EN-US">t discuss what we are doing, but simply start to play together. It is purely improvised. We make eye contact through the glass wall. This is essential. I can</span>’<span lang="EN-US">t really define it but something happens; something that has to do with intuition and trust and jeopardy &#8211; the willingness to risk and, of course, to fail. We have what is called the ‘Walk of Shame’. This is when one of us reaches for an idea that, well, clearly sucks and we epically and embarrassingly fail. If we are not doing the ‘Walk of Shame’ fairly regularly, we are not doing our job as we are not reaching beyond what is comfortable.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">The concept of collaboration has always been the power source of the Bad Seeds. On some level these collaborations have an intensity to them that can step beyond the limits of friendship </span>– <span lang="EN-US">sometimes a creative collaboration is defined by an honesty, a vulnerability and a brutal intensity that a normal friendship cannot contain. Sadly, a consequence of collaboration is that it can, on occasion, wear away at friendship, in the sense that we put so much of ourselves into the creative union that we simply forget to be friends.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">The current Bad Seeds may indeed be a testament to the corrosive capacity of collaboration. The Bad Seeds these days are on some level defined by a series of absences. It is difficult for some to see the Bad Seeds without also seeing the spirits of Blixa Bargeld, with his terrifying, tortured guitar or Mick Harvey, with his vast musical intelligence and his steely, censorious eyebrow. These extraordinarily intense musical collaborations found their natural ends but, even so, are still woven into the cloth of the band. Dear Conway and his ramshackle piano, Barry Adamson or Kid Congo Powers,</span> or <span lang="EN-US">the limitless creative spirit of Anita Lane, are all strangely present within their absence.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span lang="EN-US">Absence, on the other hand, is a fertile ground where loss and love coalesce around memory to create ghosts that live among us. </span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">Absence is not vacancy. Vacancy has no voice. Vacancy is empty and banal and atheistic. Absence, on the other hand, is a fertile ground where loss and love coalesce around memory to create ghosts that live among us. Absence is alive with energy. The Bad Seeds remain an entity that incorporates the spirits of the band</span>’<span lang="EN-US">s past members, the residue of their enormous creative energies and their remembered voices. They are all on stage with us. In my view, no one has actually </span><em><span lang="IT">gone.</span></em></p>
<p class="Body"><span lang="EN-US">In the end, I think Warren and I understand that the</span><em><span lang="NL"> longevity</span></em><span lang="EN-US">of a collaboration depends to a certain extent on the conservation of friendship </span>– <span lang="EN-US">friendships need care and constant maintenance </span>– <span lang="EN-US">and so we exist as friends beyond the work as well. We go about our work &#8211; sometimes together, sometimes apart &#8211; and we wish each other happiness, and when one of us is in trouble, the other comes a-running, as the song goes.</span></p>

					<p>Dear S.,</p>
<p>I very much like your description of the creative process – to see something imperfectly or out of the corner of your eye. This is exactly right. A good song idea never fronts up to you, never looks you in the eye, never announces itself &#8211; at least not in my experience. Lyric ideas are as illusive as fireflies. They are spirits flitting between the trees. The moment you give them your attention, they are gone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Lyric ideas are as illusive as fireflies. They are spirits flitting between the trees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But still you write, because over the years you have learned &#8211; midst the nonsensical hieroglyphics you compulsively scrawl in your notebooks,  the dumb single lines that stare contemptuously back at you, the song titles that excite you then lose their magic the next time you look at them, the half-baked and derivative ideas, the stolen lines, the Freudian doodles, the desperate over-egged metaphors and lunatic, pencil-snapping, last-ditch attempts at <em>something,</em> my God, <em>anything</em> &#8211; you  have learned to hold fast and <em>trust. </em>You have learned from hard-won experience that within this pile of words something mysterious is going on, something beyond the reaches of your understanding, something that simply takes its own sweet time and of which you are a tiny part &#8211; you are the guy who turns up to hold the pencil &#8211; and that suddenly, without warning, you find you have taken one line of no consequence and attached it to another line of no consequence and a kind of reverberation begins between the two lines, a throbbing &#8211; or as I like to call it, a ‘shimmering’ &#8211; it is something you can actually see! And as the two combined lines pulsate, they begin to collect significance impossibly, and at a rapid rate, to load up with meaning, even to call down a melody, and your heart begins to beat as if for the first time in God knows how long, and you come alive, you become an actual person, a functional, competent human being deserving of their place on this earth, because you know, suddenly, more than anything, that you are <em>on to something</em> and this shimmering convergence of words is setting off on its journey to change the world.</p>
<p>As for <em>Fireflies</em>, we are still searching for it.</p>
<p>Much love, <em>Nick</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</em></p>
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I am loving reading your questions. They are wonderful things. As some are more like short novels, the questions are sometimes embedded deep in the letter. Very deep!  I may need to edit and post just the actual question. I hope this is OK. Thank you all for your very thoughtful and considered questions.</p>
<p>Nick</p>

					<p>Dear Jenn,</p>
<p>As I write this I am sitting in a studio with Warren in California working on the new record. It‘s a strange and wonderful thing and very different from what has gone before. We are under its spell. In the meantime I have been inundated with questions. The response to The Red Hand Files has caught me completely unawares, so thank you and everyone else very much.</p>
<p>To answer your question &#8211; we have two family dogs. A gentle moony dog with sad eyes and cancer called Otis and a psychotic little dachshund called Nosferatu, whose one great enterprise in life is to bite me. I think it is safe to say that I love these dogs considerably more than they love me. They are devoted to my wife and guard her from me with their lives.</p>
<p>Nature does feature more and more in my songs. Our natural environment has become a kind of crime scene as we tear away at it, and exploit it, and burn it, and melt it. This is of considerable concern to me as an inhabitant of this world, and I feel a certain amount of existential shame for being a part of the generation that bled it dry. It saddens me as I grow old to leave such a mess for our children to deal with.</p>
<p>Having said that, the natural world in my songs is less about the destruction of the environment and more concerned with the biblical notion of paradise, within which I can set my human dramas of suffering and transcendence. My natural world is nature unspoilt, but with a kind of apocalyptic consciousness. The nature in my songs knows what’s ultimately coming. It is a world of metaphor, where nature becomes alive with the promise of God, where the moon is a mute witness and the stars hang in the air like questions.</p>
<p>For me, the imagination is essentially religious as it reaches beyond truth toward meaning. And meaning itself is a kind of truth unburdened by proof. Science has its duty to truth, and so it should, but the songwriter and the poet move beyond what is known into the unknown world. They spend their time in a kind of dream world – a realm where God and his ghosts dwell, banished there by grim reason and rationality. This is our absurd and deluded dominion in all its feverish wonder. It is the enchanted forest. This is the world from where I draw my songs. If you are an artist, well, I’ll see you there, no doubt. If not, you can sail there on my songs!</p>
<p>A final note on the dogs – my wife, Susie, is devoted to them and it would be fair to say she shows more understanding and empathy for the animal world than she does for the human world. Susie can look into the berserk eyes of Nosferatu and just melt him. She is a dog-whisper. She has the same effect on me. She is a husband-whisperer.</p>

<h1 class="post-title">What is it that the seemingly recent connection to your fans is giving you to encourage you to hold these forum-style events?</h1>
<h3>LEISA, CALOUNDRA, AUSTRALIA</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 class="post-title">Do you really feel the love of your fans? And if you do, what does it bring you?</h1>
<h3>SUZANNE, AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS</h3>
</div>
<p>Dear Leisa and Suzanne,</p>
<p>The forum style events, which I will be doing more of next year,  have to do with many things. First of all, the concerts have been  expanding, which for the band and me is clearly very exciting. I feel the show which we are doing works on a large scale – in fact I enjoy doing it more as I still feel I have a very direct connection to my audience, but there is also a massive transcendent effect that is difficult to resist. However, I am very aware that the larger format can feel alienating to long-standing fans and I wanted to find a way of staying  connected to them. This is partly the reason why I have decided to do the In Conversation events and also The Red Hand Files.</p>
<p>Leisa, when you say ‘a seemingly recent connection’, this is both true and untrue. I have always felt connected to the audience. I feel though that these days there is a place that exists beneath the stratum of our actual lived selves – a river of light that can be accessed through the live performances. It is this river of light that flows through us all and binds us together.</p>
<p>But there is another reason why I have decided to do the In Conversation events and The Red Hand Files, and that is a growing need for me to speak about certain things and not finding the appropriate places to do so. Some of the issues are difficult and require a bit of room, or space, or even nuance. I think there is much to speak about outside music as well as inside. I think people increasingly have a hunger to engage in alternative ideas about all manner of things and this is evidenced in the kind of questions that have been sent to me. I also receive a lot of mail these days from people in difficult situations and I feel that I have some experience which I can pass on.</p>
<p>Finally, in response to the ‘do I feel the love?’ question &#8211; when I am on stage I feel a very deep connection with my audience that transcends anything I have felt previously. I experience people on a ‘soul’ level that for me is extremely powerful. When I look into the audience, I feel I can connect with each of them individually on an acutely personal level. I can see inside them. The more attentive I become, the stronger the feeling. To physically engage with the audience is important too &#8211; actual touching builds both a real and a metaphorical connection and it is an essential component to the live shows. I am stealing energy when I do that &#8211; as if the audience are a power source. Perhaps I am giving it out too. The circuit is complete.</p>
<p>Without being hyperbolic, this feeling of collective love has saved my life. It is a transcendent circle that just seems to grow stronger. It is religious. A dear friend of mine, who is essentially an atheist and has no time for religious institutions, says she finds her spiritual transcendence at a Bad Seeds show. I believe her. I feel it too. It feels open and urgent and honest, and ultimately uplifting, moving us towards a sense of betterment and meaning. I arrive at this place, not by the music, but by the energy transmitted from the audience. I am awed.</p>

					<p>Dear Jakub,</p>
<p>The good news is that in the last year I have felt intensely connected to my writing. Something has definitely shifted and I have written a lot of new stuff. I can’t tell you what a relief this is. I am writing much more and it is strong and focused, in my opinion. But, you are right, for a year it had been difficult to work out <em>how</em> to write, because the centre had collapsed and Susie and I had been flung to the outer reaches of our lives. We were kind of outlanders floating in deep space.</p>
<p>But <em>what</em> had collapsed? What is at the centre of our lives? In an artist’s case (and perhaps it is the same for everybody) I would say it is a sense of wonder. Creative people in general have an acute propensity for wonder. Great trauma can rob us of this, the ability to be awed by things. Everything loses its sheen and appears beyond our reach. We were surviving, but we were surviving in exile on the perimeter of our lives, way beyond anything that mattered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">We all needed to draw ourselves back to a state of wonder. My way was to write myself there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how do we return to our lives &#8211; to the awe of existence &#8211; and reclaim a sense of wonder? Well, for me, it had something to do with work but it also had something to do with community. Work and community. I kind of realised that work was the key to get back to my life, but I also realised that I was not alone in my grief and that many of you were, in one way or another, suffering your own sorrows, your own griefs. I felt this in our live performances. I felt very acutely that a sense of suffering was the connective tissue that held us all together. It was these two things – community and work – that showed Susie and me a way forward. Work became the lifelines thrown out to us as we floated lost in narcissism and self-absorption. It also became very clear to both of us that we were not alone! We could see there were many others out there, floating around in the dark, outside of their lives. It seemed to be everywhere we looked – people in search of meaning and wonder.</p>
<p>We all needed to draw ourselves back to a state of wonder. My way was to write myself there. I sat and wrote and wrote, and in doing so I found a way back, or at least a way through the veil of grief, to the other side. I felt very strongly that the communal suffering, and our ability to transcend it, was the thing that held us together. This was not some pessimistic worldview, quite the opposite really. It became clear that as human beings we have enormous capabilities that allow us to rise above our suffering – that we are hardwired for transcendence. This was an acute realisation that changed the nature of our relationship to everything.</p>
<p>To answer your question as to whether the lyric writing has changed, I would say that it has shifted fundamentally. I have found a way to write beyond the trauma, authentically, that deals with all manner of issues but does not turn its back on the issue of the death of my child. I found with some practise the imagination could propel itself beyond the personal into a state of wonder. In doing so the colour came back to things with a renewed intensity and the world seemed clear and bright and new. So I am very happy about this. It feels good to have a notebook full of words again.</p>
<p>Here is a lyric, called <em>Fireflies</em>, which I wrote a few months ago that circles around this idea.</p>
<p>Much love, Nick</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIREFLIES</p>
<p>Jesus lying in his mother’s arms<br />
Is a photon released from a dying star<br />
We move through the forest at night<br />
The sky is full of exit wounds of light<br />
Everything we need is just too far<br />
We are fireflies a child has trapped in a jar<br />
I am here and you are where you are<br />
I am here and you are where you are</p>
<p>We have lived a long time in the forest<br />
We lie beneath the heaps of leaves<br />
We are partial to this partial light<br />
We cannot sleep and fear our dreams<br />
There is no order here, nothing can be planned<br />
We are fireflies trapped in a little boy’s hand<br />
We are photons released from a dying star<br />
I am here and you are where you are<br />
I am here and you are where you are</p>
<p>We lie among our atoms and I speak to you of things<br />
And hope sometimes that maybe you will understand<br />
There is no order here and there is no middle ground<br />
Nothing can be predicted and nothing can be planned<br />
We are fireflies pulsing dimly in the dark<br />
We are here and you are where you are<br />
We are here and you are where you are</p>
